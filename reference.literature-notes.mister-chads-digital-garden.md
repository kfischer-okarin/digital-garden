## Keeping a personal blog / Incremental Correctness

https://mister-chad.com/mind+gardens/keeping+a+personal+blog

Not everything we produce has to be perfect and final when we put it out there into the world. All classical
distribution (like blogs) mechanisms don't really encourage updating and re-working...

Brian Lovin's article [Incrementally correct personal websites](https://brianlovin.com/writing/incrementally-correct-personal-websites)
describes this concept in detail.

> Incremental correctness is the process of iterating towards something more truthful, accurate, usable, or
interesting. The faster we can iterate, the faster we can discover good ideas. Things aren't perfect today, but
tomorrow things can be slightly closer to perfect.
>
> Incremental correctness changes everything about the way you work. It's anti-perfectionism. It's pro-generation. It's
about discovery and proof, research and prototyping, and having a framework to reliably test your instincts. It
discourages major redesigns, preferring isolated improvements to a small subset of nodes in any kind of working tree.
