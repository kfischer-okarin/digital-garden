# Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)

At the moment I am still figuring out my personal process to organize my own personal knowledge.

This digital garden is basically my [open garage](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up).
## My guiding principles (so far)
### Never google something twice
During my work (and hobby activities) as a software developer I often google many things related to the tools/languages
I use. Often times I find myself looking for the same things many times over and again (as my browser history tells me).
This seems to be a bit of wasted effort, so it would be nice if I can collect snippets of things and methods I can refer
to later (probably similar to [[inbox.reading.development.jbranchaud-til]]).

### Don't be a burden
I'm a person prone to re-ordering my note taking system regularly and I want to find something that sticks and is
practicable for myself in the long run.

[[reference.dendron]] is already a step into the right direction with its great built-in refactoring capabilities,
which takes away a bit of the stress in case I go on one of my re-organization sprees again.
