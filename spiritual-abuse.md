# Spritual Abuse

## Books I might want to read
- [Escaping the Maze of Spiritual Abuse: Creating Healthy Christian Cultures](https://www.amazon.com/Escaping-Maze-Spiritual-Abuse-Christian/dp/028108131X)
  > ‘Every time he wanted me to do something, he would quote scripture... I couldn’t argue with scripture, it was like arguing with God.’
- [A Church Called Tov: Forming a Goodness Culture That Resists Abuses of Power and Promotes Healing](https://www.amazon.com/Church-Called-Tov-Goodness-Promotes/dp/1496446003)
  > Tragically, in recent years, Christians have gotten used to revelations of abuses (...) We need a map to get us from where we are today to where we ought to be as the body of Christ. That map is in a mysterious and beautiful little Hebrew word in Scripture that we translate “good,” the word tov.
