# Genesis 33

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+33&version=ESV)

## My Summary

Jacob reconciles with Esau and arrives in Canaan
- Esau reaches him and Jacob was ready for the worst of worst but contrary to his expectation Esau welcomed him with
  tears of joy
- Esau doesn't want any of Jacobs reconciliation presents he had sent earlier, but Jacob insists on him taking them
- Esau offers to lead him into the country but Jacob rejects the offer since he has many children and young animals that
  need to travel slowly and carefully
- In the end he settles down in a city called Shechem and bought a piece there
