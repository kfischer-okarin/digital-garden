# Finding my PKM process

## Requirements
- I don't want to google something twice
- Incremental, organic growth, emergent structure

## Methods that I find interesting and am evaluating
- Learning in Public[^1]
- Linking Your Thinking[^2]
- Evergreen notes[^3]
- Incremental Learning [^4]

### About Evergreen notes
> Evergreen note-making forces clear, sharp thinking. Here are the basic steps:
>
> - figure out the key statement
> - write the note in your own words
> - relate the idea in the note to your personal experiences
> - link the idea in the note to other ideas
>
> Each aspect isn't a passive process; it's an active, engaged one.
