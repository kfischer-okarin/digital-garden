# Matthew 11

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11&version=ESV)

## My Summary

- John the Baptist questions whether Jesus is really the Messiah
  - Jesus points to his own miraculous deeds as a proof
- Jesus teaches about John the Baptist
  - He is "Elijah" who is supposed to prepare the way for the Messiah as promised in Malachi 3:23
- Jesus criticizes cynical public opinions that always find a fault
  - John was "too holy" so he must have been possessed by a demon
  - Jesus was "too lax" so he was called a glutton and irreliable for hanging out with the wrong crowd
- Jesus criticizes the cities that have seen so many of his wonders
  - If Tyre, Sidon, Sodom - the historically most sinful cities a Jew could imagine - had seen those miracles they
    would have repented
- God is hiding the truth from those who are wise in their own and in the world's eyes and reveals it to humble persons
  (those like children)
- Only God knows the Son, and only the Son and those the Son chooses will know God
- Jesus invites us to receive real, deep peace and rest for our burdened souls
  - He invites us to learn from him, who is gentle and humble
  - He invites us to take his yoke, which is light, because he is carrying it with us
