In this way, “fools” were highly revered and respected.</p>\n<p>In the modern, creative world, especially in games, we have artists and architects, writers and actors,\nmusicians and critics, witches and wizards, and so many more.\nEach one of these creators offers a unique role and a unique frame of mind with which to view the world.\nWhy not acknowledge the value of our own fools as well?</p>\n<p>If we take the time to cast aside the negative connotations that society has associated with the foolish,\nwe stand to find a treasure trove of qualities that we can benefit from as creators...</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"the-fool-is-simple\">The Fool is simple.<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-fool-is-simple\"></a></h2>\n<p>Their ways and methods are often inefficient and run counter to what most consider to be “common sense”.\nYet, efficiency and what is considered to be proper practice is hardly ever their concern.\nTheir perspective may, on occasion, reveal a problem to be far less complicated than others believe it to be.\nOr their deviant ways may unveil previously unrecognized solutions. In their work, they tend to look beyond results,\nbeyond any form of performative measurements, and instead allow meaning and purpose to arise from whatever comes to be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fool-is-humble\">The Fool is humble.<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-fool-is-humble\"></a></h2>\n<p>They understand their own smallness in the universe and make the most of whatever situation they find themself in.\nThey embrace their own faults and shortcomings, sometimes even celebrate them.\nThey speak truthfully about themselves and others, gently removing the facades created by arrogance and pride,\nexposing the shared humanity in all of us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fool-is-comedic\">The Fool is comedic.<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-fool-is-comedic\"></a></h2>\n<p>They laugh at themselves and at others, sometimes at their own expense.\nWith their light touch and a revelation of the ridiculousness of the world, they unwittingly combat the\npiousness and pompousness that plagues our day-to-day interactions with others.\nThey find joy among the joyless and inspire us to laugh alongside each other, not at each other.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fool-is-playful-and-free\">The Fool is playful and free.<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-fool-is-playful-and-free\"></a></h2>\n<p>They are explorative at heart. They often pay absurdly acute attention to the seemingly mundane,\nperhaps bringing something new that was previously  overshadowed to light.\nThey are free spirited in their ways, flowing in whichever way the river of creativity takes them,\nas opposed to following a regimented and formulaic set of rules and what has become standardized success.\nThey show us the cages that we have put ourselves in.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Fool is the child in all of us, taking over the driver’s seat for a change.\nAs we all grow older, we lose touch with our childhood innocence and playfulness,\nour small, simplistic views of this world we’ve been dropped into, and it’s replaced\nwith concerns about deadlines, finances, career prospects, and arguing over which game engine is the best.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, then, the Fool shouldn’t be writing this manifesto.\nTo what purpose will it serve the Fool to read a manifesto they will more than\nlikely not bother to follow in the first place?</p>\n<p>Yet the Fool will try, exploring with whatever experience they have.\nThe Fool will learn, reflecting upon the failures they encounter.\nThe Fool will laugh, acknowledging their own shortcomings.\nAnd the Fool will try again.</p>\n<p>The world is a beautiful place, filled with joy, sadness, and mystery.\nYet our modern- day ideals have painted it over with the dark colors of solemnity.\nAs creators, we must try our best to seek out and reflect upon the ambiguous elements that touch us in unknown ways.\nThe Fools remind us of the simpler, more immediate experiences we have once enjoyed, and by following their example -\nby viewing ourselves and our work through their simplistic, humble, comedic, and playful lenses -\nwe too might discover something the rest of the world willfully overlooks.\nThe effect that it will have on us all, might pleasantly surprise you. And the laughter will no doubt follow.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","title":"Home","desc":"","updated":1660372010574,"created":1648806032875,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","name":"digital-garden","selfContained":true},"contentHash":"0d5b5a84c07edaf83aeeab9a0b1a2b42","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"contact_me","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":55,"offset":331},"end":{"line":10,"column":69,"offset":345},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"contact_me"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.gamedev","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":402},"end":{"line":14,"column":20,"offset":419},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.gamedev"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.software-development","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":3,"offset":422},"end":{"line":15,"column":33,"offset":452},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.software-development"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"reference.faith-and-work","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":5,"offset":517},"end":{"line":17,"column":33,"offset":545},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"reference.faith-and-work"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"reference.adhd","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":583},"end":{"line":19,"column":21,"offset":601},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"reference.adhd"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.pkm","alias":"Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":604},"end":{"line":20,"column":52,"offset":653},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.pkm"}}],"anchors":{"welcome-to-my-little-corner-of-the-internet":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to my little corner of the internet","value":"welcome-to-my-little-corner-of-the-internet","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1},"topics-i-care-about":{"type":"header","text":"Topics I care about","value":"topics-i-care-about","line":19,"column":0,"depth":2},"media-i-enjoy":{"type":"header","text":"Media I enjoy","value":"media-i-enjoy","line":28,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["ckpt5dqzm4fv2ysnyyqi5q7","qexkgwym6yebjwrl1pz2wco","contact_me","gk4xjszil72ursnl10ui5ht","tu102fn6psvc3ef33p2jl5p","426vv89cwpwrk3pezm4idax","ceagbmx4k3i5sokhd3n8iyf","43bj5hyl41q0txr2e0rhcaw","sjq1fqcpyomz6hii19blfsh","krioclkr3atix89tw0300y8","5j5jqiz50loi24n5r18y9kd","hn6qnp0te5vs8l76eik6o4c"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Welcome to my little corner of the internet\n\nHey, everyone!\n\nI'm Kevin and this page is my own shot at a Digital Garden[^1].\n\nThis is a low-barrier[^2] experiment for myself to organize my thoughts and publish content and maybe find like-minded\nindividuals to connect with.\n\nThis space will slowly evolve over time.
