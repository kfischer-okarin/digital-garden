This method kick starts the day with a fun thing, then rewards me for doing boring\ntasks by getting to do more fun things!</li>\n<li>Having less time available makes me more productive. Getting temp office work has given me the structure and urgency\nI need to fit in my freelance and personal projects, which I was struggling to get done when I had the whole day at\nhome.</li>\n<li>You need to <em>embrace</em> the things that are fun and interesting, not try focus on the hard stuff first.</li>\n<li>‚ÄúMake the consequence hurt more.‚Äù has never motivated me, it just makes the consequence hurt more. üôÉ Instead, I try\nto make consequences light, but drum up the urgency with timers, public accountability, etc.</li>\n<li>I determine when is \"The absolute last second\" I can start a project and have it done on time.</li>\n<li>Reward yourself before doing something not after. Our brains don't really believe in the future.</li>\n<li>Follow the distractions! This is how I get tons of work done both for my job and at home. Sometimes, it's not the\nworst thing to just allow yourself to be distracted by things (within reason) and go with the flow of it. If it's\ntruly urgent it will come up again</li>\n<li>Inspiration is perishable, so following immediate ‚Äúdistractions‚Äù can lead to great productivity; just not necessarily\nin the direction you might have planned, or expected. Stay agile, and see where it takes you.</li>\n<li>Sometimes I do a \"Ta da!\" list where I just write down things I've already done and check them off. Makes the list a\nlot less intimidating when most of the things are checked off.</li>\n<li>Stay up super late if it means you‚Äôre going to finish something. Because once you get out of the zone, it‚Äôs so hard\nto get back in!</li>\n<li>Compartmentalize. ADHD sufferers get hit with executive dysfunction REALLY easily. Not just because a job is huge,\nbut because it contains a dozen other jobs we might find ourselves being pulled into.</li>\n<li>I make everything ritualistic so I never have to DECIDE to do something.\nEvery Tuesday I go grocery shopping.\nEvery Friday I put gas in my car.\nEvery Sunday I do laundry.\nWhen I turn off the lights at night, I put new coffee grounds in the pot.\nEvery time.</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","title":"Home","desc":"","updated":1660372010574,"created":1648806032875,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","name":"digital-garden","selfContained":true},"contentHash":"0d5b5a84c07edaf83aeeab9a0b1a2b42","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"contact_me","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":55,"offset":331},"end":{"line":10,"column":69,"offset":345},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"contact_me"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.gamedev","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":402},"end":{"line":14,"column":20,"offset":419},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.gamedev"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.software-development","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":3,"offset":422},"end":{"line":15,"column":33,"offset":452},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.software-development"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"reference.faith-and-work","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":5,"offset":517},"end":{"line":17,"column":33,"offset":545},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"reference.faith-and-work"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"reference.adhd","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":583},"end":{"line":19,"column":21,"offset":601},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"reference.adhd"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.pkm","alias":"Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":604},"end":{"line":20,"column":52,"offset":653},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.pkm"}}],"anchors":{"welcome-to-my-little-corner-of-the-internet":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to my little corner of the internet","value":"welcome-to-my-little-corner-of-the-internet","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1},"topics-i-care-about":{"type":"header","text":"Topics I care about","value":"topics-i-care-about","line":19,"column":0,"depth":2},"media-i-enjoy":{"type":"header","text":"Media I enjoy","value":"media-i-enjoy","line":28,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["ckpt5dqzm4fv2ysnyyqi5q7","qexkgwym6yebjwrl1pz2wco","contact_me","gk4xjszil72ursnl10ui5ht","tu102fn6psvc3ef33p2jl5p","426vv89cwpwrk3pezm4idax","ceagbmx4k3i5sokhd3n8iyf","43bj5hyl41q0txr2e0rhcaw","sjq1fqcpyomz6hii19blfsh","krioclkr3atix89tw0300y8","5j5jqiz50loi24n5r18y9kd","hn6qnp0te5vs8l76eik6o4c"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Welcome to my little corner of the internet\n\nHey, everyone!\n\nI'm Kevin and this page is my own shot at a Digital Garden[^1].\n\nThis is a low-barrier[^2] experiment for myself to organize my thoughts and publish content and maybe find like-minded\nindividuals to connect with.\n\nThis space will slowly evolve over time.
