I heard that often said\nin sermons)</li>\n<li>This is a parable about believers and unbelievers as Jesus explains later. Jesus brings the good news to the people\nbut Satan has put his children among them. God might not remove/judge them right away - but in the end that sorting\nwill be done by his angels at judgement day.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The parable of the mustard seed\n<ul>\n<li>It's a tiny seed but turns into a huge tree</li>\n<li>The kingdom also starts small and invisibly but has a huge influence</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The parable of the leaven\n<ul>\n<li>Leaven is small compared to the whole dough but it takes just a little time for it all to become leavened</li>\n<li>Similar meaning as the one with the mustard seed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Parables about treasures\n<ul>\n<li>The parable of the hidden treasure\n<ul>\n<li>The man who stumbled across the treasure sold everything to buy the land as fast as he could</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The parable of the pearl\n<ul>\n<li>The merchant actively looked for the pearl, he also sold everything he had to buy it</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Both are often interpreted as teaching that believers should be willing to give up everything to gain eternal life,\nenter the kingdom\n<ul>\n<li>But considering the other parables about \"found\" things (coins, sheep, son) have God as the person seeking the\nlost, it would make sense that God is the protagonist in this parable too</li>\n<li>God giving up everything, i.e. his only Son so humans could be reconciled with him...
