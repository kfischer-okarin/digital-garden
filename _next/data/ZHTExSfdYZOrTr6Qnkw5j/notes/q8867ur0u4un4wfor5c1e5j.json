This third sentence reinforces the point you're making with some sort of credibility or amplified description. And this fourth sentence rounds out your argument, guiding the reader toward your conclusion.</p>\n<p>This fifth sentence is your strong conclusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What makes this 1/3/1 sequence \"work\" is that the first sentence and the last sentence act as bookends to the bulk of the content in the middle. These single-sentence lines make the reader feel as though they've reached a checkpoint, which acts as a small dopamine hit encouraging them to continue reading.</p>\n<p>1/3/1 is an especially great framework for introductions and openers, but the truth is, it can be used anytime, anywhere within your writing. In fact, you could write an entire essay or article (or even book) using the 1/3/1 sequence and readers wouldn't realize you were following a pattern. They would just think to themselves, \"Wow, this thing flows so well! It's so easy to read.\"</p>\n<p>Here's an example of the 1/3/1 sequence in action:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>100 years ago, The Campbells's Soup Company had a breakthrough.</p>\n<p>For 30 years, the business sold little else besides produce, canned tomatoes, vegetables, jellies, condiments, minced\nmeats, and of course, soups. Business was good, but there was nothing \"radically different\" about these products.\nCanning had been widely accepted as a method for sealing food since the early 1800s, and even when pasteurization was\ninvented in 1864, fresh foods were difficult products to scale. Soup, for example, while cheap to make (its primary\ningredient being water), was still heavy and expensive to ship.</p>\n<p>Until, in 1895, a chemist within the company named John T. Dorrance came up with a radically different idea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>from <a href=\"https://categorypirates.substack.com/p/campbells-soup-and-how-to-design\">Campbell's Soup &#x26; How To Design A Category Breakthrough In The Roaring 2020s</a></p>","noteIndex":{"id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","title":"Home","desc":"","updated":1660372010574,"created":1648806032875,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","name":"digital-garden","selfContained":true},"contentHash":"0d5b5a84c07edaf83aeeab9a0b1a2b42","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"contact_me","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":55,"offset":331},"end":{"line":10,"column":69,"offset":345},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"contact_me"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.gamedev","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":402},"end":{"line":14,"column":20,"offset":419},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.gamedev"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.software-development","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":3,"offset":422},"end":{"line":15,"column":33,"offset":452},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.software-development"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"reference.faith-and-work","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":5,"offset":517},"end":{"line":17,"column":33,"offset":545},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"reference.faith-and-work"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"reference.adhd","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":583},"end":{"line":19,"column":21,"offset":601},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"reference.adhd"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.pkm","alias":"Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":604},"end":{"line":20,"column":52,"offset":653},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.pkm"}}],"anchors":{"welcome-to-my-little-corner-of-the-internet":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to my little corner of the internet","value":"welcome-to-my-little-corner-of-the-internet","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1},"topics-i-care-about":{"type":"header","text":"Topics I care about","value":"topics-i-care-about","line":19,"column":0,"depth":2},"media-i-enjoy":{"type":"header","text":"Media I enjoy","value":"media-i-enjoy","line":28,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["ckpt5dqzm4fv2ysnyyqi5q7","qexkgwym6yebjwrl1pz2wco","contact_me","gk4xjszil72ursnl10ui5ht","tu102fn6psvc3ef33p2jl5p","426vv89cwpwrk3pezm4idax","ceagbmx4k3i5sokhd3n8iyf","43bj5hyl41q0txr2e0rhcaw","sjq1fqcpyomz6hii19blfsh","krioclkr3atix89tw0300y8","5j5jqiz50loi24n5r18y9kd","hn6qnp0te5vs8l76eik6o4c"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Welcome to my little corner of the internet\n\nHey, everyone!\n\nI'm Kevin and this page is my own shot at a Digital Garden[^1].\n\nThis is a low-barrier[^2] experiment for myself to organize my thoughts and publish content and maybe find like-minded\nindividuals to connect with.\n\nThis space will slowly evolve over time.
