I‚Äôll never cancel this meeting, but you can cancel it whenever you like. It‚Äôs your time.</li>\n<li>Our 1:1 agenda will be in the meeting invite so we remember important topics. But you‚Äôre always free to use the time\nfor whatever‚Äôs on your mind.</li>\n<li>When I schedule a meeting with you, I‚Äôll always say <em>when I schedule it</em> what it‚Äôs meant to be about. I will not\nschedule meetings without an agenda.</li>\n<li>When I drop into your DM‚Äôs, I‚Äôll always say ‚Äúhi and why.‚Äù No suspense, no small talk while you are wondering what I\nwant.</li>\n<li>News or announcements that significantly impact you, your work, or your team will come from me directly in a 1:1,\nnot revealed in a big meeting.</li>\n<li>You‚Äôll get feedback from me when it‚Äôs fresh. There will be no feedback in your performance review that you‚Äôre\nhearing for the first time.</li>\n<li>I trust you to manage your own time. You don‚Äôt need to clear with me in advance your time AFK or OOO.</li>\n<li>Your work gets done your way. My focus is on outcomes, not output. Once we‚Äôre clear on where we need to go, how to\nget there is up to you. If I ever find it necessary to suggest a specific approach, I will supply an example.</li>\n<li>A team is strongest when it‚Äôs working together, looking after one another, and taking care of each other. Please\nlook to your left and to your right for opportunities to help your colleagues. Please ask for help when you need it.\nNobody works alone.</li>\n<li>I trust you to skip level and talk to my manager or other senior management about anything you feel is relevant.\nYou don‚Äôt need to clear it with me, and I‚Äôm not going to get weird about it when you do.</li>\n<li>I will attribute credit appropriately to you and your team. I will never exaggerate my own role or minimize your\ncontribution. I‚Äôll be especially certain to nail down attribution when senior management are hearing of our\naccomplishments.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If this sounds good to you, please reciprocate by giving me in return what I need most: The truth. Give me your\nfeedback, say when I‚Äôm wrong, and tell me your ideas for how we can do better.</p>\n<p>If we trust each other, we can learn and grow together. That‚Äôs how I want to work with you.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/MrEchs/status/1516024678074171402\">Matthew Rechs on Twitter</a></p>","noteIndex":{"id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","title":"Home","desc":"","updated":1660372010574,"created":1648806032875,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","name":"digital-garden","selfContained":true},"contentHash":"0d5b5a84c07edaf83aeeab9a0b1a2b42","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"contact_me","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":55,"offset":331},"end":{"line":10,"column":69,"offset":345},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"contact_me"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.gamedev","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":402},"end":{"line":14,"column":20,"offset":419},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.gamedev"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.software-development","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":3,"offset":422},"end":{"line":15,"column":33,"offset":452},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.software-development"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"reference.faith-and-work","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":5,"offset":517},"end":{"line":17,"column":33,"offset":545},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"reference.faith-and-work"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"reference.adhd","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":583},"end":{"line":19,"column":21,"offset":601},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"reference.adhd"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.pkm","alias":"Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":604},"end":{"line":20,"column":52,"offset":653},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.pkm"}}],"anchors":{"welcome-to-my-little-corner-of-the-internet":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to my little corner of the internet","value":"welcome-to-my-little-corner-of-the-internet","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1},"topics-i-care-about":{"type":"header","text":"Topics I care about","value":"topics-i-care-about","line":19,"column":0,"depth":2},"media-i-enjoy":{"type":"header","text":"Media I enjoy","value":"media-i-enjoy","line":28,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["ckpt5dqzm4fv2ysnyyqi5q7","qexkgwym6yebjwrl1pz2wco","contact_me","gk4xjszil72ursnl10ui5ht","tu102fn6psvc3ef33p2jl5p","426vv89cwpwrk3pezm4idax","ceagbmx4k3i5sokhd3n8iyf","43bj5hyl41q0txr2e0rhcaw","sjq1fqcpyomz6hii19blfsh","krioclkr3atix89tw0300y8","5j5jqiz50loi24n5r18y9kd","hn6qnp0te5vs8l76eik6o4c"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Welcome to my little corner of the internet\n\nHey, everyone!\n\nI'm Kevin and this page is my own shot at a Digital Garden[^1].\n\nThis is a low-barrier[^2] experiment for myself to organize my thoughts and publish content and maybe find like-minded\nindividuals to connect with.\n\nThis space will slowly evolve over time.
