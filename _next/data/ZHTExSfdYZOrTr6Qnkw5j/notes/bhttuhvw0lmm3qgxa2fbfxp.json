So why is it important for people to post more?</li>\n<li>C: If they post more other people might read about our games.</li>\n<li>M: That's another behavior change not a big picture. Why is it important that they read about the games?</li>\n<li>C: If they read about it they will come and play the games more.</li>\n<li>M: That's another behavior change. Why is that important?</li>\n<li>C: That's a stupid question\n<ul>\n<li>When you hear something like that you're onto something good</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>M: So you want more players... How many more? Would it be a waste of time if after 9 months you had 5 more players?</li>\n<li>C: No, no, no we need 1 million more players\n<div class=\"mermaid\">\n    flowchart LR\n    1m(1M Players) --- Players\n    Players --- pm(Post More)\n    pm --- la(Levels and Achievements)\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>He actually had a problem but came with a solution instead, we just had a structured conversation to unpack the\nproblem</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>M: So this is our destination... and these are some of the roads we could take... Let's not take a tunnel for 9 months\nbut let's try out if this is actually a good idea. Something simple we could quickly do would be allowing people to\npost about tournament wins... so we can test the hypothesis about players posting more.\n<div class=\"mermaid\">\n    flowchart LR\n    1m(1M Players) --- Players\n    Players --- pm(Post More)\n    pm --- la(Levels and Achievements)\n    pm --- tw(Tournament Winners)\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They tried out tournament winners and after three days no one shared their wins anymore because they didn't want to\nspam their friends. So making players post more about a stupid Facebook game doesn't seem to work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>M: We could try to make people invite others</li>\n<li>C: So here we asked our marketing department and they gave us this:\n<div class=\"mermaid\">\n    flowchart LR\n    1m(1M Players) --- Players\n    Players --- pm(Post More)\n    pm --- la(Levels and Achievements)\n    pm --- tw(Tournament
