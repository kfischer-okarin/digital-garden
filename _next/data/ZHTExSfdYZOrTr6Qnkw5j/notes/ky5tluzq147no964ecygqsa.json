(This is probably since we humans are made in the image of a creator).</p>\n<p>I once made a longer game for a research project during my first exchange study here in Japan in 2013. It was an RPG\nMaker game with a little bit of Machine Learning added to select one of two final scenarios based on the players\npreferences which were derived from data collected throughout gameplay.</p>\n<p>Making the game was also fun but also hard - for the final part I had quite some help from my brother.\nAnd  in the end the science employed during the game had more than just a few holes conceptually. But the thing that\nmade the biggest impression on me was actually conducting the user studies and watching people (half of them my\ninternational student friends... the other half random people from campus) play the game I had made.\nSeeing their reactions - joy, frustration, satisfaction when overcoming a challenge...\nThat made a very deep impression on me...</p>\n<p>I would like to make games that deeply resonate with people (at least some people)...\nI don't know, that probably why anyone makes games....</p>\n<p>Maybe to capture that magic spark that I myself experienced when I played my first video games as a child\n(Secret of Mana &#x26; Breath of Fire 2 come to mind as exampels that made a profound impression)... Or even later in life\nwhen you play a wildly innovative games like Outer Wilds.</p>\n<p>I want to grow my own little branch on my creative genealogy (to use Austin Kleon's words).</p>\n<p>I partly want to make games because I wish such a game would exist.</p>\n<p>Getting any money for that and possibly even be able to live from that would be a big bonus -\nthough I have to say that I despise the idea of having to work my creative motor and my games as a business and/or\nfocused on surviving from that....</p>\n<p>So unless I'm blessed with a wild success either career-wise or with one of my games I guess want to aim for a living\nsituation that is well-paying and not too time-consuming (for example an established freelancer) while having lots of\ntime to hack on games......</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/digital-garden/notes/6l8bkr9dd1y2gki01z3t80e\">Game Development</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","title":"Home","desc":"","updated":1660372010574,"created":1648806032875,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","name":"digital-garden","selfContained":true},"contentHash":"0d5b5a84c07edaf83aeeab9a0b1a2b42","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"contact_me","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":55,"offset":331},"end":{"line":10,"column":69,"offset":345},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"contact_me"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.gamedev","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":402},"end":{"line":14,"column":20,"offset":419},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.gamedev"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.software-development","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":3,"offset":422},"end":{"line":15,"column":33,"offset":452},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.software-development"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"reference.faith-and-work","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":5,"offset":517},"end":{"line":17,"column":33,"offset":545},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"reference.faith-and-work"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"reference.adhd","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":583},"end":{"line":19,"column":21,"offset":601},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"reference.adhd"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"w4mxpqpj9ftyo6pw17k3wj6","vaultName":"digital-garden"},"value":"areas.pkm","alias":"Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":604},"end":{"line":20,"column":52,"offset":653},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"areas.pkm"}}],"anchors":{"welcome-to-my-little-corner-of-the-internet":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to my little corner of the internet","value":"welcome-to-my-little-corner-of-the-internet","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1},"topics-i-care-about":{"type":"header","text":"Topics I care about","value":"topics-i-care-about","line":19,"column":0,"depth":2},"media-i-enjoy":{"type":"header","text":"Media I enjoy","value":"media-i-enjoy","line":28,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["ckpt5dqzm4fv2ysnyyqi5q7","qexkgwym6yebjwrl1pz2wco","contact_me","gk4xjszil72ursnl10ui5ht","tu102fn6psvc3ef33p2jl5p","426vv89cwpwrk3pezm4idax","ceagbmx4k3i5sokhd3n8iyf","43bj5hyl41q0txr2e0rhcaw","sjq1fqcpyomz6hii19blfsh","krioclkr3atix89tw0300y8","5j5jqiz50loi24n5r18y9kd","hn6qnp0te5vs8l76eik6o4c"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Welcome to my little corner of the internet\n\nHey, everyone!\n\nI'm Kevin and this page is my own shot at a Digital Garden[^1].\n\nThis is a low-barrier[^2] experiment for myself to organize my thoughts and publish content and maybe find like-minded\nindividuals to connect with.\n\nThis space will slowly evolve over time.
