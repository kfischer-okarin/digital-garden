## Alignment

- Design = Alignment
- You don't have to use a single line but still things are aligned to each other

## Use HSL for colors
- It's very intuitive compared to RGB
- You can easily make boring colors more interesting by adjusting their hue
- Make color less overpowering/visible by reducing saturation


## Design principles

## Playfulness
- Pastel colors (i.e. less saturation and more brightness)
- Scattered elements in the background (to break up the "grid")
- Fonts with imperfect kerning (space between letters) or stroke-weights make things quirky
