# Austin Kleon - Steal like an Artist

## Embrace influence, don't run from it
> There's nothing new under the sun

[Ecclesiastes 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ecclesiastes+1%3A9&version=ESV) ([[reference.bible.ecclesiastes.01]])

- Things that feel original just have references that you haven't detected yet
- We don't have to be under pressure to create something entirely original, it's normal to be influenced and inspired

## Studying your artist genealogy
- Instead of studying a whole art field, study an artist you really love deeply
- Study three people that artist loved the same way
- Repeat as often as you can

## Collect ideas!
- Don't hoard indiscriminately, steal what resonates with your soul
- Carry a notebok everywhere, jot, doodle around
- Have a swipe file to keep inspiring things inside


## Quotes

- > Art is theft

  Pablo Picasso
