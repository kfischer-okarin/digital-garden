# The universe shows God's greatness

> (3) When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,<br/>
> the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,<br/>
> (4) what is man that you are mindful of him,<br/>
> and the son of man that you care for him?

[Psalm 8:3-4](https://esv.org/Psalm8:3) #bible.psalm.008

Looking at the whole huge universe (the size of which we probably don't even begin to grasp), how great and powerful
must the being that made all of this be?

- **Epistemic Status:** One of my personal convictions as a Christian, contentwise yet a work in progress. Greatness
  is also maybe not the best word, but I need to understand the often used term "glory" better before I can use it with
  confidence.
