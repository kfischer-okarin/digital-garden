# Humans have authority over creation

> (5) Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings<br/>
> and crowned him with glory and honor.<br/>
> (6) You have given him dominion over the works of your hands;<br/>
> you have put all things under his feet,

[Psalm 8:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+8%3A5-6&version=ESV) ([[reference.bible.psalms.008]])

God gave us authority over everything in this world. We are basically second in command, directly instituted by God.

That authority also comes with a responsibility to take good care of the earth, a job which once could say we haven't
done all too well anymore during the last 100 years or so considering issues like environmental pollution, extinction of
animals, global warming etc.

- **Epistemic Status:** One of my personal convictions as a Christian, contentwise yet a work in progress. Probably
  needs a spinoff note on the authority of humans once I think/write more on that. Also more hard data about global
  warming and the other issues might be appropriate.
