<ul>
<li>Selective Simplification
<ul>
<li>Ignore details irrelevant to the problem at hand
<ul>
<li>The main goal is to solve domain-related problems for the user</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The goal is not to be as realistic as possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consciously structured knowledge
<ul>
<li>It is distilled knowledge formed over time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It evolves over time
<ul>
<li>Once concepts don't prove useful anymore they are dropped
<ul>
<li>If it was tied to another needed concept, remodeling to separate those concepts must happen first</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is collaboratively developed by developers and domain experts
<ul>
<li>A brainstorming and experimentation attitude is needed</li>
<li>It should not just be done by one party and then handed down in a waterfall fashion to the developers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It contains not just a data schema but also behaviour and enforced rules</li>
</ul>
<p>It is closely connected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A common ubiquitous language between all project members
<ul>
<li>The ease or awkwardsness of the chosen model can be determined by actually using it when speaking about the project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The actual implementation, which makes it easier to maintain the corresponding source code</li>
</ul>
