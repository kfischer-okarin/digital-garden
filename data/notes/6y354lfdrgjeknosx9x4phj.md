- Common interpretations of the story include:
  - Temptation of hubris (pride)
  - Perils of technical innovation

## What did the Babel builders do wrong?
- Were they just a brotherly society of dedicated builders?
- Were they becoming too proud for their own good? With the help of technology?
- Did God need to destroy them because they were a threat?
- The phrase used for "making bricks" (nilbena levenim) is only used **one** other time in the Bible
  - In Exodus when the pharao forces the Israelites to increase their brick output without giving them straw
    [[reference.bible.exodus.5]]
  - Making bricks basically required slave labor in the ancient world
- The word for "come" (as in "Come, let us...") (havah) - is like a forceful "Come on!", i.e. forcing something lesser
  in power to fulfill your wish as a ruler
  - Other uses are:
    - The pharao wanting to enslave the Israelites [[reference.bible.exodus.1]]
    - Judah strongly demanding sex from a prostitute in [[reference.bible.genesis.38]]
- The "city fortified up to the skies" is similar in wording like the cities in Canaan that were built by wicked
  societies [[reference.bible.deuteronomy.9]]
  - "impossible" (as in "nothing [...] will now be impossible") is actually also an allusion to the fortified cities
    (the Hebrew word yibbatzer)
- "propose" (as in "nothing that they propose") has a connotation of plotting to pervert justice
- So what is described in Genesis 11 is the birth of the first exploitative empire (The Akkadian Empire) in Mesopotamia
- The single language was an enforced empire language - a regression from the diversity after the spreading out of the
  descendants of Noah in [[reference.bible.genesis.10]]
- Wanting to stay in one place (to solidify ones power) was a direct contradiction to God's command before after the
  flood "Be fruitful and multiply" in [[reference.bible.genesis.9]]

## Why did God punish them as He did?
- To break up the exploitative society
- In the end it was a blessing in disguise - to regain diversity

## What's the message?
- We should abhor injustice
- We should embrace the goods of diversity
- God is there as a good parent to guide our steps even if we fail at living up to those standards
