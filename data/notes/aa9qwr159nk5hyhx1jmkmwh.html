<p>Jacob reconciles with Esau and arrives in Canaan</p>
<ul>
<li>Esau reaches him and Jacob was ready for the worst of worst but contrary to his expectation Esau welcomed him with
tears of joy</li>
<li>Esau doesn't want any of Jacobs reconciliation presents he had sent earlier, but Jacob insists on him taking them</li>
<li>Esau offers to lead him into the country but Jacob rejects the offer since he has many children and young animals that
need to travel slowly and carefully</li>
<li>In the end he settles down in a city called Shechem and bought a piece there</li>

<ul>
<li>Schechem (the city where Jacob settled in <a href="/digital-garden/notes/49syz34k69qqmsqg5vnqu98">Genesis 33</a> was probably named after him) was attracted
to Jacob's daughter Dinah and rapes her and then asks his father to organize that she should get married to him</li>
<li>His father brings that proposal to Jacob and his sons</li>
<li>The sons deceived him by saying that they would accept the offer if all men in the city would get circumcised and they
accepted, thinking that they would get hold of Jacob's wealth by connecting their families in marriage</li>
<li>Few days later when the men's circumcision wounds were hurting Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, came to the city,
killed every man inside and stole all their women and possessions</li>
<li>Jacob was not very happy about this since they might now be hated by the people of Canaan, but the brothers cared more
about their sister's honor</li>

<p>Judah sleeps with his daughter-in-law Tamar</p>
<ul>
<li>Judah moved away from his brothers and married a Canaanite woman</li>
<li>He had three sons Er, Onan and Shelah, Tamar was Er's wife</li>
<li>Er was an immoral person so the Lord let him die</li>
<li>Then Onan was asked to give a son to Tamar so Er's family would continue but he refused to do so, so the Lord let him
die, too</li>
<li>Judah outwardly promised Tamar to give Shelah to her once he was old enough but never intended to do so since he was
afraid that he might also die</li>
<li>Eventually Shelah was old enough and was not given to Tamar</li>
<li>Judah's wife had died by now and one day when he went out to shear his sheep Tamar dressed up with a veil as a
prostitute and waited for him at the street</li>
<li>Judah slept with her after she took Judah's signet and cord as a pledge for her eventual payment
<ul>
<li>Judah went back to give her her payment but couldn't find her and forgot about her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When it was known that Tamar was pregnant, Judah ordered her to be burned for prostitution - but she then presented
his possessions she had taken as pledge in defense and Judah admitted his fault
<ul>
<li>He let her live in his house but never touched her again</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tamar gave birth to twins, Perez and Zerah</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this incident she becomes one of the ancestors of Jesus.</p>

devoured them and the same dream with 7 fat ears of grain eaten by 7 thin ears.</li>
<li>The cupbearer remembered Joseph and told the Pharao about him and Joseph was taken out of prison</li>
<li>He told him the message that God wanted the Pharao to know through this dreams, namely that 7 years of abundance would
come followed by 7 years of famine and that Egypt needs to prepare for this</li>
<li>Pharao decided to let Joseph handle this since he seems to have great wisdom and he made him second in authority over
Egypt</li>
<li>He was also given the daughter of an important priest as wife. She gave birth to Manasse and Ephraim who should become
heirs of Israel later

<li>The events predicted by the dream came true and Joseph stored the surplus of grain in the 7 abundant years</li>
