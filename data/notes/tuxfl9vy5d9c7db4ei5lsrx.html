<ul>
<li>Tutorial
<ul>
<li>oriented to learning</li>
<li>must allow the newcomer to get started</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>How-to guide

<li>like a recipe in a cookery book</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reference
<ul>
<li>oriented to information</li>
<li>must describe the machinery</li>
<li>presented as a dry description</li>
<li>like a reference encyclopedia article</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explanation
<ul>
<li>oriented to understanding</li>
<li>must explain the why, backgrounds etc</li>
<li>presented as a discursive explanation</li>
<li>like an article on culinary social history</li>
</ul>

<p>Following this distinction will help both the author (they will know what and how to write) and the reader.</p>
<h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#tutorials"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>You are the teacher and responsible for leading the student through a series of steps to achieve some end</li>
<li>Must be achievable and meaningful</li>
<li>Once the tutorial is finished the learner can make sense of the software and the rest of the documentation</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> to teach is less important than that the learner
<ul>
<li>finds it enjoyable</li>
<li>gains confidence</li>
<li>wants to do it again</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Through the tutorial the learner will learn some important things about the software, how it is to use the software
day by day</li>
<li>You decide what the learner will learn and in which order - the goal is basic familiarity with the software!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Let the user learn by doing</li>
<li>It's ok to have hand-held baby steps at first, what they do doesn't have to be best practice just needs to get them
started</li>
<li>Make sure the tutorial works!
<ul>
<li>You cannot help the learner if something fails, make sure it works!!!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each step should do something small and comprehensible, it should be visible
<ul>
<li>Don't let them do random, complicated things for 2 pages before seeing any feedback</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It must be repeatable for people with many different environments</li>
<li>Focus on concrete steps, particular actions and outcomes</li>
<li>Only give the minimum necessary explanation - link to refeerence/explanation elsewhere
<ul>
<li>Don't introduce other unneeded options</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-guides">How-to guides<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-to-guides"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Presents steps required to solve a real-world problem
<ul>
<li>The question asked could only be posed by someone with some experience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You wouldn't explain basics that normally experienced people know already or discuss concepts</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="principles-for-writing-them-1">Principles for writing them<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#principles-for-writing-them-1"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Provide a series of steps to achieve the goal
<ul>
<li>No need to start from the beginning or go to the very end, just include the main important part</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focus only on the goal</li>
<li>Link to explanations if they are important to the steps</li>
<li>Be flexible enough to allow for variations of the problem you describe</li>
<li>Name them as a complete "How to"-sentence</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reference">Reference<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#reference"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Technical description of a machinery</li>
<li>Can include basic description of how to use something and what to pay attention to when using
<ul>
<li>But does not contain steps to achieve a particular goal! That's job of the How-to guides</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You want pure information in a systematic presentation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="principles-for-writing-them-2">Principles for writing them<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#principles-for-writing-them-2"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Structure the reference around the code</li>
<li>Use consistent structure, format, tone</li>
<li>Do nothing but describe!</li>
<li>It must be exact and up-to-date</li>
