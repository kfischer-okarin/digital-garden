- [ ] Draw out **all** possible interconnected elements of the problem (even if you think you know where the problem is)
- Until you find the cause:
  - [ ] Choose the next unexamined element
    - For example the most unlikely, one in the middle
  - [ ] Timebox to eliminate the element (25 minutes)
    - Try to reproduce locally, read logs
    - Stop after 25 and make notes about the rabbit hole
  - [ ] Take a break
  - [ ] Review the state of the diagram
