<p>(5) Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings<br>
and crowned him with glory and honor.<br>
(6) You have given him dominion over the works of your hands;<br>
you have put all things under his feet,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+8%3A5-6&#x26;version=ESV">Psalm 8:5-6</a> (<a href="/digital-garden/notes/rp8zz8mgxfowvq8jlyffvxb">Psalm 8</a>)</p>
<p>God gave us authority over everything in this world. We are basically second in command, directly instituted by God.</p>
<p>That authority also comes with a responsibility to take good care of the earth, a job which once could say we haven't
done all too well anymore during the last 100 years or so considering issues like environmental pollution, extinction of
animals, global warming etc.</p>

<li><strong>Epistemic Status:</strong> One of my personal convictions as a Christian, contentwise yet a work in progress. Probably
needs a spinoff note on the authority of humans once I think/write more on that. Also more hard data about global
warming and the other issues might be appropriate.</li>
