# Welcome to my little corner of the internet

Hey, everyone!

I'm Kevin and this page is my own shot at a Digital Garden[^1].

This is a low-barrier[^2] experiment for myself to organize my thoughts and publish content and maybe find like-minded
individuals to connect with.

This space will slowly evolve over time. Feel free to [[contact_me]] if you want to get in touch.

[^1]: I recommend the explanation on [Joschua's Garden](https://joschuasgarden.com/Digital+garden) and his digital garden in general.

[^2]: I personally thought several times about starting a blog for sharing game development, software engineering tidbits/ramblings but my tendency for perfectionism especially with regard to minor details like names, design, style as well as the perceived pressure of having to regularly output some kind of meaningful content stopped me from actually going through with it until now.
