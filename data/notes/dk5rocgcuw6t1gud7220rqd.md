## My Summary

## What is XP?
- Getting over our own surety that "I know better than everyone else and all I need is to be left alone to be the
  greatest"
- XP = Stay aware, adapt, change
- Everything in software changes, we must be able to cope with change

## Values, Practices, Principles
- Practices: Specific, concrete things you do day to day
  - can have benefits even if you don't share values or understand principles behind them
- Values: Why you do things, purpose of practices
  - practices are evidence of values, they bring accountability
  - Master craftsmen know what's really valuable by experience
- Principles: Domain specific guidelines for life
  - Connecting values and practices

## Values of XP

### Communication
- Talk to people, they might have had a similarly problem before already
- When a problem happens ask yourself
  - Was it caused by lack of communication?
  - What communication can I take now to address it?
  - What communication can you take in the future to avoiding getting into the same problem again?

### Simplicity
- > What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?
- Improving communication can improve Simplicity by removing unneeded or not yet needed requirements
- Improving simplicity improves Communication since there's less to communicate about

### Feedback
- We don't know what is the "right" way to build things from the beginning - we need constant feedback
- Types of feedback
  - opinions about an idea
  - how the code looks
  - whether tests are easy to write
  - how it works
- Generate as quick and much feedback as you can handle
- if you can't handle feedback quickly enough you need to fix that first

### Courage
- Effective action in the face of fear
  - speak truths pleasant or unpleasant to foster communication and trust
  - discard failing solutions to get simplicity
  - seek real concrete answers to get feedback
  - not acting even though it seems serious and urgent to get to the foundation of an issue

### Respect
- caring for the other team members, the project and their work
- everyone on the team is important

## Principles of XP

### Remember software is made by humans
- they have needs that need to be met
- needs of the individual need to be balanced with the needs of the team
- the individual must find a way to meet their needs without hurting the team
- people find that they can actually more themselves if they trust the team
- but don't make others uncomfortable by sharing too private things during work time

Related values: Communication, Respect

### Remember the economics in play
- somebody has to pay for all this
- spend money as late as possible = work incrementally (time value of money)
- if possible build solutions that can reasonably be reused (option value of systems)
  - but don't build in yet unneeded features for some kind of we might use it someday scenario

Related values: Simplicity, Respect (the budget payers money), Feedback

### Build for mutual benefit
- for you now, the customer and you in the future

Related values: Respect others

### Reuse patterns that work (self-similarity)
- patterns that work at one level / place (e.g. test driven day to day development) often also prove to work at
  others (acceptance test driven sprints)

Related values: Simplicity

### Improve continuosly and incrementally
- improve right now as much as you realistically can and get to work - don't wait for perfection
- use feedback to improve further

Related values: Feedback, Courage (to start even if not 100% perfect)

### Seek diversity
- different point of views and the resulting conflicts are opportunities for even better work

Related values: Communication, Feedback, Respect others, Courage (to allow yourself to be criticized for the sake of
the project)

### Reflect on your work
- analyse how and why we do work
- analyse why you succeeded or failed and learn from it
- using both official retrospective meetings and informal settings
- listen to what your "negative" emotions are pointing at
- but don't stay in analysis paralysis but get to work

Related values: Feedback, Communication, courage (to face your own mistakes)

### Keep up a steady flow
- shorten your feedback cycles
- tackle blockers of flow with priority
- usually other problems will solve itself along the way
- resist the temptation to lengthen feedback cycles because of problems

Related values: Feedback, Courage (to tackle flow problems even if other tasks seem more urgent)

### Turn problems into learning opportunities
- don't just try to survive, improve!

Related values: Feedback, Courage

### Embrace redundancy
- it seems wasteful to tackle the same problem at several levels but its effective
- catching defects as one main problems is tackled at many levels
  - pair programming
  - continuous integration
  - real customer involvement
  - daily deployment
  - etc

Related values: Feedback, Respect (for the customer to deliver defect free software)

### Fail rather than do nothing
- If you don't know how to do something well, try several ways even if they might fail

Related values: Feedback, Courage

### Never compromise on quality
- Quality should never be a control variable, scope can be
- Low quality will slow down predictable delivery
- People will be demotivated if they deliver work they cannot be proud of
- Don't use quality as an excuse for not acting, just do it the best way you know at the moment

Related values: Courage (to cut down scope to not compromise on quality), Respect (for the customer you deliver to)

### Make baby steps
- > What is the least you could do that is recognisably in the right direction?

Related values: Feedback

### Accept responsibility and have authority
- No one can assign responsibility to you, you can only accept it
- Who is responsible should also have the ultimate say about how to do their work

Related values: Communication, Respect
