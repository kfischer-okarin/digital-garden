<h2 id="building-species">Building Species<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#building-species"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Roleplaying Style
<ul>
<li>Make up a kind of species you like to be</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Min Max Style
<ul>
<li>Totally focus on one thing with traits and civics (e.g. Engineering research)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Random Species</li>
<li>Challenge Run</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exploration">Exploration<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#exploration"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>about 4-5 Science ships in the beginning</li>
<li>Research only anomalies at most 1 level above the scientist</li>
<li>If you need to expand quick, Leave anomalies in the beginning and focus on finding your neighbors</li>
<li>Capture chokepoint systems
<ul>
<li>Keeping neutral dangers alive in those systems can be a good defense</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="traditions">Traditions<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#traditions"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>usually Discovery / Expansion is good in the beginning</li>
<li>Expansion is good for grabbing new space - good for more aggressive play</li>
<li>Ascension Perks
<ul>
<li>Technological Ascendancy is a good first one (but it depends on your playstyle)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supremacy and Unyielding (DLC) are good for fighting</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="research">Research<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#research"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Material sciences is a good focus in the beginning</li>
<li>Recommended Techs
<ul>
<li>Powered Exoskeletons -> Robotics</li>
<li>Planetary Unification</li>
<li>Flat research bonuses first</li>
<li>Also getting Population growth is usually good</li>
<li>Destroyer</li>
<li>Starhold</li>
<li>Star Fortress &#x26; Battleships will lead to Mega Engineering</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="planet-management">Planet Management<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#planet-management"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Remove blockers to have more population growth
<ul>
<li>You can remove blockers during colonizing!</li>
<li>Turn on edict using Motes to speed up blocker removal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good first buildings: Gene Clininics, Robot Factory</li>
<li>Clerks are not very good in the beginning but can be useful when low on amenities</li>
<li>Designations
<ul>
<li>Urban World is good because it reduces building upkeep (including special resources for advanced buildings)</li>
<li>Mining World not only boosts mining but also Special Resources</li>
<li>Factory/Forge world forces industry districts to only have jobs of their type instead of 1 Artisan and 1
Metallurgist</li>
<li>Tech World Designation is quite useless: Researcher upkeep is too little to be worth it, better boost your secondary
infrastructure on Research worlds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't build more than you need/can work
<ul>
<li>But: New Colonies have high immigration pull (until 10 pops) so it's might be worth to have 5-6 open jobs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Districts
<ul>
<li>City / Industry is unlimited</li>
<li>other districts depend on features</li>
<li>It's good to specialize planets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jobs
<ul>
<li>Don't produce too many specialist/ruler jobs since pops will promote themselves readily but will only very slowly
demote themselves again</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="starbases">Starbases<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#starbases"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Build Naval</li>
<li>Have Hydroponic Farms where ever possible</li>
<li>Over colonies having a Transit Hub is good</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="policies">Policies<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#policies"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Liberation Wars allows you to wage war to change an enemy ethic</li>
<li>Expansionist is not so good actually - Cooperative is better once you have a neighbor and want to be friendly with
them</li>
<li>Economic policy gives you either an advantage in consumer goods or in alloys</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="factions">Factions<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#factions"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Promote one easy to please faction with a good presidential candidate</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trade">Trade<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#trade"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Trade value is collected from Starports with tradehubs (1 Range per tradehub) - or from same system without anything</li>
<li>Trade policy decides what Trade Value is being converted into</li>
<li>Trade routes attract pirates which can be kept away with fleets patrolling along the route</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="war">War<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#war"></a></h2>
<ul>

<li>Ways to end a war

<li>Achieve all war goals</li>
<li>Surrender</li>
<li>Make a settlement of the current status quo</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tactics
<ul>
<li>Don't move your fleet in node systems where enemies could come from many sides - let a science ship go there first
to explore</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After war there will be definitely 10 years of peace and open borders</li>
<li>If you set Ground Army vessels to aggressive stance they will follow your naval vessels and automatically conquer
planets if they think they can win</li>
<li>If you incorporate new species/planets
<ul>
<li>Make sure to build precinct houses to decrease crime</li>
<li>Give them only residence rights if their ethics are too different so they cannot have too much political influence</li>
<li>Suppress factions with contrary ethics</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Corvette: Brawler (main), Screen (support), Gunship (secondary)</li>
<li>You need better power first before you can use better shields</li>
<li>Usually it's good to have a good mix of armor and shield</li>
