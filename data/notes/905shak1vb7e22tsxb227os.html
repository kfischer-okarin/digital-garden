<ul>
<li>
<p>Problem 1: Motivation</p>
<ul>
<li>Neurotypicals are motivated by rewards, importance, consequences</li>
<li>For ADHD people it doesn't really work the same way (though they understand it theoretically)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Problem 2: Distractions</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a lot to tweak in those Productivity Systems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Problem 3: Overwhelm</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There comes a point where everything becomes too much and we just drop everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neurotypicals just say: Suck it up and do the hard work, even if it's hard or boring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ADHD people just <strong>can't</strong> do it</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Lot's of the advice doesn't really work</p>
<ul>
<li>Get up earlier</li>
<li>Inbox zero</li>
<li>Be a stoic</li>
<li>Workout 2 hours a day</li>
<li>Don't have carbs or sugar etc</li>
<li>Eat the frog first
<ul>
<li>No, we just stare at the frog for hours and feel like a failure for avoiding the frog all day</li>
<li>What's wrong with you, why does it work perfectly well for everyone else</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Break a big project into all of its steps
<ul>
<li>Scenario 1:
<ul>
<li>Wow that's a lot of steps, I'm terrible at estimating time, now it feels like this infinite project</li>
<li>Maybe let's turn on some Netflix</li>
<li>Maybe I'll start tomorrow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scenario 2:
<ul>
<li>Get bored of the steps, think of something interesting, open 50 tags on related topics</li>
<li>What was the project again?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It <strong>doesn't work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It sounds like logical advice but it just doesn't work</li>
<li>Self-Blame
<ul>
<li>Why is this working for others but not for me???</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Great intentions, failed action
<ul>
<li>We have big intentions but our actions don't measure up</li>
<li>People might call us lazy</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>We are driven by <strong>interest</strong> rather than importance, consequences or rewards</li>
<li>The 4 Cs of Motivation
<ul>
<li>Captivate
<ul>
<li>Something you find fascinating</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create
<ul>
<li>Creating something new</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compete
<ul>
<li>We love a good challenge</li>
<li>Someone tells you: You can't do that - and suddenly it becomes your life goal to prove them wrong</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Complete
<ul>
<li>Setting due dates and deadlines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It fuels our motivation</li>
<li>We build up momentum that spills over into other activities</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips">Tips<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#tips"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Eat the ice cream first, rather than the frog - and then use the motivation for the frog</li>
<li>Instead of listing up all the steps... list up the first few steps pick the most interesting and get rolling down
the track</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strategies">Strategies<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#strategies"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Embrace the switching of systems (Captivate &#x26; Create)
<ul>
<li>Productivity systems (or any systems) work for a while for us - and that's great</li>
<li>Once it stops working that's also ok, then we can embrace the next thing. No need for self-blame</li>
<li>Also no need to pour all your heart and hope into the next system but rather go at it with a more relaxed attitude</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pomodoro Timers (Compete &#x26; Complete)
<ul>
<li>It's ok to be flexible on the timing</li>
<li>When you're hyperfocuses still use a timer to get a break after a longer time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for Sidequests (Captivate)
<ul>
<li>Can be a danger since you can get totally sidetracked</li>
<li>But can be useful to get motivation/momentum for the project you <strong>have</strong> to do</li>
<li>Maybe set a timer, too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Micro Commitments (Complete)
<ul>
<li>Just commit to do 2 dishes or so - and feel free to walk away !</li>
<li>If you're lucky you built up enough momentum to do all of it.. or a lot...
<ul>
<li>but it's ok if not!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change your environment (Create)
<ul>
<li>Sometimes try to work in a coffee shop</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make tests &#x26; Paperwork into a game (Create)
<ul>
<li>Maybe just answer every other question... or answer them backwards</li>
<li>Maybe set a timer to get some urgency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set time-based goals
<ul>
<li>I'm going to clean the office for 10 minutes</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Putting lots of energy (almost to an obsessive extent) into "that new idea that might finally work" is a very familiar
experience for me... Both happened with Getting Things Done and even with starting to use Dendron and earlier Emacs</li>
<li>Listing up all the steps and the demotivation coupled with that - makes software estimation quite difficult for me -
I want to find a good process for that.</li>
