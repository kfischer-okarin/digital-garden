<p>If we read only until human creation and know nothing else about God... Then we see that
<a href="/digital-garden/notes/30u69hrr7exibov9mfqy6bk">he is a worker</a> who creates good things.</p>
<p><a href="/digital-garden/notes/noser6ccw8zj5wgnttefcj6">God Cares about the Material World</a></p>
<ul>
<li>we actually don't see him create souls and angels etc</li>
</ul>
<p>The garden of Eden was not complete</p>
<ul>
<li>it was perfect in the sense that it was perfectly resourced having all you might ever need</li>
<li>but it was made to be worked by the human</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Business exists to create opportunities for individuals to express aspects of their God given identity in meaningful
and creative work</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Business exists in order to produce goods and services that would enable the community to flourish</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Business exists to serve others</p>
<ul>
<li>internally to provide people with meaningful work</li>
<li>externally to provide the community with resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Profit is the means not the end, it's necessary to do your service</p>
<p>Business must be sustainable (environment and stakeholders)</p>
<p>Businesses for better or worse will have the most power to change the world more than any one nation can have</p>
<p>The world needs business leaders with a purpose</p>
<ul>
<li>they are usually amazing world changers
<ul>
<li>they are the best at getting a lot out of a little</li>
<li>they organize and deploy resources with remarkable efficiency</li>
<li>they tend to be optimistic</li>
<li>they look for the win win solution when everyone else just sees tradeoffs</li>
<li>once they think they're on the right course they are willing to stick with it even in face of enormous obstacles</li>
</ul>
</li>
