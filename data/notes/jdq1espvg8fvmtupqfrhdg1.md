## Write content first
Write all the content before designing anything. The design should support the content not constrain it to make it
fit the design.

### Writing copy

## Line length
- One line should be between 45-75 characters ideally.
- Adjust text column width to fit that

## Use more Uppercase
- Feel free to use uppercase text in short text elements like menus, headlines, button labels
- It draws attention to those things
- It gives a bigger sense of alignment (i.e. that something was designed with intention)

## Text on Images
- Text on images usually looks good!
- But if the image could be anything (like an user-uploaded profile picture), readability can be a problem
- Some solutions:
  - Use a dark box around the text
  - Floor Fade - Use a black gradient on the bottom of the picture
  - Tint the whole picture
  - Text shadow (sometimes unreliable)
