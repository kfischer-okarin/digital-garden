# Domain Model

- Selective Simplification
  - Ignore details irrelevant to the problem at hand
    - The main goal is to solve domain-related problems for the user
  - The goal is not to be as realistic as possible
- Consciously structured knowledge
  - It is distilled knowledge formed over time
- It evolves over time
  - Once concepts don't prove useful anymore they are dropped
    - If it was tied to another needed concept, remodeling to separate those concepts must happen first
- It is collaboratively developed by developers and domain experts
  - A brainstorming and experimentation attitude is needed
  - It should not just be done by one party and then handed down in a waterfall fashion to the developers
- It contains not just a data schema but also behaviour and enforced rules


It is closely connected to:
- A common ubiquitous language between all project members
  - The ease or awkwardsness of the chosen model can be determined by actually using it when speaking about the project
- The actual implementation, which makes it easier to maintain the corresponding source code
