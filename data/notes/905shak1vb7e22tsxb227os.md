## Introduction
- People telling you, you're "not reaching your potential" (whatever that means in their mind)
- Trying harder doesn't work
- > He looked at me like I was stupid.<br/>
    **I'm not stupid.**

  Hamilton
- Getting Things Done Movement
  - Often spending weekends working on the "perfect" system...
  - It then worked for a few days/weeks but in the end it comes crashing down
  - Couldn't trust his own brain

## Flaws of Neurotypical Productivity Techniques
- Problem 1: Motivation
  - Neurotypicals are motivated by rewards, importance, consequences
  - For ADHD people it doesn't really work the same way (though they understand it theoretically)
- Problem 2: Distractions
  - There's a lot to tweak in those Productivity Systems
- Problem 3: Overwhelm
  - There comes a point where everything becomes too much and we just drop everything
  - Neurotypicals just say: Suck it up and do the hard work, even if it's hard or boring
  - ADHD people just **can't** do it
  - > Imagine you're drowning... then someone hands you a baby.

    Jim Gaffigan
- Lot's of the advice doesn't really work
  - Get up earlier
  - Inbox zero
  - Be a stoic
  - Workout 2 hours a day
  - Don't have carbs or sugar etc
  - Eat the frog first
    - No, we just stare at the frog for hours and feel like a failure for avoiding the frog all day
    - What's wrong with you, why does it work perfectly well for everyone else
  - Break a big project into all of its steps
    - Scenario 1:
      - Wow that's a lot of steps, I'm terrible at estimating time, now it feels like this infinite project
      - Maybe let's turn on some Netflix
      - Maybe I'll start tomorrow
    - Scenario 2:
      - Get bored of the steps, think of something interesting, open 50 tags on related topics
      - What was the project again?
- It **doesn't work**
  - It sounds like logical advice but it just doesn't work
  - Self-Blame
    - Why is this working for others but not for me???
  - Great intentions, failed action
    - We have big intentions but our actions don't measure up
    - People might call us lazy

## What to do about it?
- We are driven by **interest** rather than importance, consequences or rewards
- The 4 Cs of Motivation
  - Captivate
    - Something you find fascinating
  - Create
    - Creating something new
  - Compete
    - We love a good challenge
    - Someone tells you: You can't do that - and suddenly it becomes your life goal to prove them wrong
  - Complete
    - Setting due dates and deadlines
- It fuels our motivation
- We build up momentum that spills over into other activities

## Tips
- Eat the ice cream first, rather than the frog - and then use the motivation for the frog
- Instead of listing up all the steps... list up the first few steps pick the most interesting and get rolling down
  the track

## Strategies
- Embrace the switching of systems (Captivate & Create)
  - Productivity systems (or any systems) work for a while for us - and that's great
  - Once it stops working that's also ok, then we can embrace the next thing. No need for self-blame
  - Also no need to pour all your heart and hope into the next system but rather go at it with a more relaxed attitude
- Pomodoro Timers (Compete & Complete)
  - It's ok to be flexible on the timing
  - When you're hyperfocuses still use a timer to get a break after a longer time
- Look for Sidequests (Captivate)
  - Can be a danger since you can get totally sidetracked
  - But can be useful to get motivation/momentum for the project you **have** to do
  - Maybe set a timer, too
- Micro Commitments (Complete)
  - Just commit to do 2 dishes or so - and feel free to walk away !
  - If you're lucky you built up enough momentum to do all of it.. or a lot...
    - but it's ok if not!
- Change your environment (Create)
  - Sometimes try to work in a coffee shop
- Make tests & Paperwork into a game (Create)
  - Maybe just answer every other question... or answer them backwards
  - Maybe set a timer to get some urgency
- Set time-based goals
  - I'm going to clean the office for 10 minutes

## My Questions, Thoughts, Comments
- Putting lots of energy (almost to an obsessive extent) into "that new idea that might finally work" is a very familiar
  experience for me... Both happened with Getting Things Done and even with starting to use Dendron and earlier Emacs
- Listing up all the steps and the demotivation coupled with that - makes software estimation quite difficult for me -
  I want to find a good process for that.
