# 1  Corinthians 11

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11&version=ESV)

## Background
- The admonition to cover their head was because Corinthian women wore their hair open when they went to to dinner
  parties (convivia) where several immoral activities took place: "Escorts", idol meat, adultery, drunkenness (All
  topics mention in 1 Corinthian 6-11). Covering their hair was not a matter sexual modesty - just of modesty in
  general.
