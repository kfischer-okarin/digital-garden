<p>Judah sleeps with his daughter-in-law Tamar</p>
<ul>
<li>Judah moved away from his brothers and married a Canaanite woman</li>
<li>He had three sons Er, Onan and Shelah, Tamar was Er's wife</li>
<li>Er was an immoral person so the Lord let him die</li>
<li>Then Onan was asked to give a son to Tamar so Er's family would continue but he refused to do so, so the Lord let him
die, too</li>
<li>Judah outwardly promised Tamar to give Shelah to her once he was old enough but never intended to do so since he was
afraid that he might also die</li>
<li>Eventually Shelah was old enough and was not given to Tamar</li>
<li>Judah's wife had died by now and one day when he went out to shear his sheep Tamar dressed up with a veil as a
prostitute and waited for him at the street</li>
<li>Judah slept with her after she took Judah's signet and cord as a pledge for her eventual payment
<ul>
<li>Judah went back to give her her payment but couldn't find her and forgot about her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When it was known that Tamar was pregnant, Judah ordered her to be burned for prostitution - but she then presented
his possessions she had taken as pledge in defense and Judah admitted his fault
<ul>
<li>He let her live in his house but never touched her again</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tamar gave birth to twins, Perez and Zerah</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this incident she becomes one of the ancestors of Jesus.</p>
