<li>People have more concurrent ongoing commitments/projects than in the past</li>
<li>With physical labor it's usually clear when work was done, a field plowed, a bread baked etc
<ul>
<li>Nowadays the definition of "Done" is not so clear anymore</li>
<li>When is your plan, article, meeting preparation etc perfect? - You could always do more, always use more information
etc</li>

</li>
<li>Work is more complex and involves communicating with many people often from other departments and of other professions</li>
<li>Teams work globally thanks to modern technology</li>
<li>Most people don't do only what they were hired for</li>
<li>Commitment to continual learning</li>
<li>Changes in life are frequent and often times sudden (health issues, family, financial challenges)</li>

<li>When we think about higher levels, our standard of living and working usually rises and that causes more work that
needs to be organized</li>
