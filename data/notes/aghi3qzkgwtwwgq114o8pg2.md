## My Summary

## Part 1: Putting the Domain Model to Work
> A model is a simplification. It is an interpretation of reality that abstracts the aspects relevant to solving the
  problem at hand and ignores extraneous detail.

> A model is a selectively simplified and consciously structures form of knowledge.

## Chapter 1: Crunching Knowledge
- Try to understand the words of the experts
