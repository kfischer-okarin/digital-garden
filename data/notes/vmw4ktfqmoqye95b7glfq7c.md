## Mistakes to avoid on Upwork:
- Copy/Paste the same message for every job application
- Not reading the post and missing important info
- Not responding quickly to messages
- Not asking to get on a video call

## Plan of action:
- Create a great profile: picture, intro, make it personal.
- Create a boilerplate template & adjust it for new clients.
- Don’t be a robot; you won’t stand out.
- Focus on one type of job (for me it was PM).

## How to send effective applications on Upwork:
- Read the full post & make sure you can be valuable to the client.
- Give them a unique solution for their needs.
- Have a list of previous work you have done.
- Request a video call.

## How to land jobs quickly:
- I set up an advanced search on Upwork.
- Created an RSS Feed.
- Added the RSS feed to Slack.
- I get immediate notifications for relevant work.
- I would be one of the first people to apply.

## Here is what I did:
- First 5 months: outreach, outreach, outreach. Get the reps in.
- I sent out 20-30 applications per day.
- Once I landed a few clients, reworked my profile & add new skills.
- Raised my hourly rate every 2-3 new clients.
- Asked for reviews.
- Low-hanging fruit:
  - In the beginning, I didn’t care how small the project was. I wanted to deliver results, get reviews, and keep
    growing.
- My strategy was:
  - Once someone works with me, they get the results they expected, they will be happy, and I will be happy.

## How to communicate effectively on Upwork:
- If you get invited to a job, respond asap.
  - You need to request a video call the same day if you get a response.
- Showcase your expertise by providing a solution in your response.
- Communicate with confidence.
- You need to follow up with clients every couple of days.

## What did I charge?
- I started at $30/hr when I landed my first two clients.
- After I get two 5-star reviews, I would raise it to $35/hr.
- After a few more reviews, I was quickly at $75/hr.
- Then I got up to $250/hr.
- Now I have a minimum $20k project cost.
