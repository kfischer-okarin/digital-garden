<ol>
<li>Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can</li>
<li>Rewrite it over and over</li>
<li>Cut out everything unnecessary</li>
<li>Write in a conversational tone</li>
<li>Develop a nose for bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours;</li>
<li>Imitate writers you like</li>
<li>If you can't get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said</li>
<li>Expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be
wrong</li>
<li>Be confident enough to cut</li>
<li>Have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which bits are confusing or drag</li>
<li>Don't (always) make detailed outlines</li>
<li>Mull ideas over for a few days before writing; carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you</li>
<li>Start writing when you think of the first sentence; if a deadline forces you to start before that, just say the most
important sentence first</li>
<li>Write about stuff you like</li>
<li>Don't try to sound impressive</li>
<li>Don't hesitate to change the topic on the fly</li>
<li>Use footnotes to contain digressions</li>
<li>Use anaphora to knit sentences together</li>
<li>Read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the
paragraphs you dread reading)</li>
<li>Try to tell the reader something new and useful</li>
<li>Work in fairly big quanta of time</li>
<li>When you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far</li>
<li>When you finish, leave yourself something easy to start with</li>
<li>Accumulate notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don't feel obliged to cover any of them;</li>
<li>Write for a reader who won't read the essay as carefully as you do, just as pop songs are designed to sound ok on
crappy car radios</li>
<li>If you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately</li>
<li>Ask friends which sentence you'll regret most</li>
<li>Go back and tone down harsh remarks</li>
<li>Publish stuff online, because an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more ideas</li>
<li>Print out drafts instead of just looking at them on the screen</li>
<li>Use simple, germanic words</li>
<li>Learn to distinguish surprises from digressions</li>
<li>Learn to recognize the approach of an ending, and when one appears, grab it.</li>
