<blockquote>
<p>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew
first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written,
“The righteous shall live by faith.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes,
namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in
the things that have been made. So they are without excuse</p>
