<h2 id="my-summary">My Summary<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#my-summary"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The Pharisees critize Jesus and his followers for supposedly working on th Sabbath
<ul>
<li>Jesus' disciples gather heads of grain since they were hungry
<ul>
<li>Jesus replies that even David and his followers were allowed to eat bread that was reserved for the priest since
it was an emergency</li>
<li>Finally he says, he is the Lord over the Sabbath and thus has the freedom to say what's ok and what's not anyways</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jesus himself heals a man's withered hand in a synagogue
<ul>
<li>Jesus replies that even the Pharisees would save their sheep if it was in trouble on the Sabbath and this points
out their hypocrisy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These controversies and Jesus replies moves the Pharisees to plan to kill Jesus</li>
<li>Jesus heals many people but tells them to stay quiet - this fulfills a prophecy in <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">reference.bible.isaiah.42 (Private)</a></li>
<li>The Pharisees say that Jesus' power to heal and drive out demons comes from Satan himself
<ul>
<li>Jesus destroys their logic immediately
<ul>
<li>If Satan was starting to fight himself, his kingdom would be destroyed already - and obviously that's not the case
(there are still possessed people and evil is happening in the world)</li>
<li>If he was using Satan's power, which power were the Pharisee's using (and how could they prove it wasn't Satan,
too?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He warns them that resisting the Holy Spirit so much that they not only denying his power but even attribute to
Satan will send them down on a path from which they will not be able to return to God</li>
<li>Jesus also tells about how telling out words/behaviour are about our heart</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scribes and Pharisees demand miracles as proof
<ul>
<li>Jesus says that they won't get any more miracles than they are seeing already anyways - except for his upcoming
resurrection from the dead (which he hints at with a comparison with Jonah)</li>
<li>If they won't listen now - they wouldn't listen even with more miracles</li>
<li>Jesus calls himself one bigger than Jonah and Solomon - but still they won't listen</li>
<li>Then talks about a driven out spirit (?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jesus calls all fellow believers his brothers and sisters</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Blaspheming the Holy Spirit (v 31-32)</li>
<li>Driven out spirit returning to the human from where it was driven out and brings seven other spirits with it (v 43-45)
<ul>
<li>Is this talking about the empty religiousness of the pharisees that leaves them worse off in the end than if they
had been "just" not interested in God at all?</li>
</ul>
