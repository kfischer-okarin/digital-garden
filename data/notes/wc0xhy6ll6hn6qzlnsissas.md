# Genesis 11

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+11&version=ESV)

## My Summary
- People of the world gathered and decided to build a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens
- God came and looked at what they've built and decided that it is better to spread them all over the earth
- He confused their language and the project failed - The city was called Babel from thereon
- The descendants from Shem up to Abram are listed
- Abram's father Terach took him, his wife and Lot, his nephew, and left from Ur close to Babel where they lived to go
  to Canaan but they settled halfway in Haran

## Central verses for me
> And the Lord said, â€œBehold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of
what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
