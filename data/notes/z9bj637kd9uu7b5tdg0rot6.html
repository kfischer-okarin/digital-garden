<blockquote>
<p>And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother,
of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!” Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm
for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there. Then he washed his face
and came out. And controlling himself he said, “Serve the food.”</p>
