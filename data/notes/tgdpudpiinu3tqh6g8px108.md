# Four Thousand Weeks

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Oliver-Burkeman/dp/1784704008)

Battling an overfilled inbox?
Your ever-lengthening to-do lists?
Struggling against distraction?
What if you tried to stop doing everything, so you could finally get round to what counts?

If you live to 80, you'll have barely more than four thousand weeks on earth. How will you decide how to spend them?

Rejecting the futile modern obsession with 'getting everything done,' Four Thousand Weeks introduces readers to tools
for constructing a meaningful life by embracing rather than denying their limitations.

Drawing on the insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual teachers, Oliver
Burkeman sets out to realign our relationship with time - and in doing so, to liberate us from its tyranny.
