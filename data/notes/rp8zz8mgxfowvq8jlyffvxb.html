<p>A song of praise: God's name is majestic.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ol>
<li>He is the creator of the universe, to be praised by all people. He made the universe and everything in it and as
everyone can easily see it's huge und incredibly complex.</li>
<li>He made the human, though incredibly small compared to the whole universe, the highest among his created beings, he
gave us authority over all the creation and also directly interacts with us. That is a unique privilege.</li>
</ol>
