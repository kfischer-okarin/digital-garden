# UI Design
- Can you just let a description stand alone instead of labeling it?
- Can you use a name/title as heading?
- Can you use tag/icon displays for yes/true values?
- Can you display information visually rather than with text?
- Does your spacing properly group the content?
- Can you [spice up](https://www.learnui.design/blog/spice-up-designs.html) your design?
