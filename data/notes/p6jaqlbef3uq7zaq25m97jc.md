# Matthew 12

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12&version=ESV)

## My Summary

- The Pharisees critize Jesus and his followers for supposedly working on th Sabbath
  - Jesus' disciples gather heads of grain since they were hungry
    - Jesus replies that even David and his followers were allowed to eat bread that was reserved for the priest since
    it was an emergency
    - Finally he says, he is the Lord over the Sabbath and thus has the freedom to say what's ok and what's not anyways
  - Jesus himself heals a man's withered hand in a synagogue
    - Jesus replies that even the Pharisees would save their sheep if it was in trouble on the Sabbath and this points
      out their hypocrisy
- These controversies and Jesus replies moves the Pharisees to plan to kill Jesus
- Jesus heals many people but tells them to stay quiet - this fulfills a prophecy in [[reference.bible.isaiah.42]]
- The Pharisees say that Jesus' power to heal and drive out demons comes from Satan himself
  - Jesus destroys their logic immediately
    - If Satan was starting to fight himself, his kingdom would be destroyed already - and obviously that's not the case
      (there are still possessed people and evil is happening in the world)
    - If he was using Satan's power, which power were the Pharisee's using (and how could they prove it wasn't Satan,
      too?)
  - He warns them that resisting the Holy Spirit so much that they not only denying his power but even attribute to
    Satan will send them down on a path from which they will not be able to return to God
  - Jesus also tells about how telling out words/behaviour are about our heart
- Scribes and Pharisees demand miracles as proof
  - Jesus says that they won't get any more miracles than they are seeing already anyways - except for his upcoming
    resurrection from the dead (which he hints at with a comparison with Jonah)
  - If they won't listen now - they wouldn't listen even with more miracles
  - Jesus calls himself one bigger than Jonah and Solomon - but still they won't listen
  - Then talks about a driven out spirit (?)
- Jesus calls all fellow believers his brothers and sisters

## Open questions / Difficult passages
- Blaspheming the Holy Spirit (v 31-32)
- Driven out spirit returning to the human from where it was driven out and brings seven other spirits with it (v 43-45)
  - Is this talking about the empty religiousness of the pharisees that leaves them worse off in the end than if they
    had been "just" not interested in God at all?
