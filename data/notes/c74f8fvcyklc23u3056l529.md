## Step 1 (5 min)
Do a word chain (next word starts with the last letter of the previous word)
- Try to use uncommon words

|No|Word|
|--|------|
|1 |      |

## Step2 (20 min)
Idea creation
- Write two (if possible three ideas) which come to you mind when you combine the theme and the word
- It doesn't matter if it doesn't exactly fit the word
- Quantity over quality
- Feel free to write crazy, over the top ideas
- If you think for 20-30 seconds and don't come with any idea you can skip to the next word
- Completely focus on this task

|No|Theme|Word|Idea|Idea 2|Idea 3 (if possible)|
|--|-----|----|----|------|--------------------|
|1 |     |    |    |      |                    |


## Wait (5 min)
- Good job! Take a five minute break.

## Step 3 (10 min)
Idea selection
- Chose useable ideas from Step 2
- Tip: You could look at the list in Step 2 and mark possible candidates with a background color before making your final choice
- If you had any ideas you came up before participating you can write them here, too
- Feel free to polish up the ideas

|No|Idea|Explanation|
|--|----|-----------|
|1 |    |           |

## Step 4
Presentation
- 1 Minute per person
