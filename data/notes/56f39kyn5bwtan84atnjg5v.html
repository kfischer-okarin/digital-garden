<p>Ezekiel's speech from The Walking Dead, Season 8, Episode 4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We face dire challenge and chance.
Our lives... our way of life... it hangs in the balance, a fragile glass standing on a wire, high above the asphalt, as we pray for not one drop of rain under an overcast sky.
And yet, I smile.
We will fight, and we will bleed...
and yet I smile.
We shall face men, some cornered into their roles by circumstance, some desperate murderers thrilled by blood. We shall end them all. As is our charge this day. As is our sorrow.
And yet, I smile.
We will leave our loved ones... to traverse a dangerous road. Rushing out of peace into war.
And yet, I smile.
For we will mine glory from the rock of struggle this day. We will honor and protect this... this bastion of life in a land of the dead, and we will win. You trust the king... we will win.
I smile... I laugh... I rejoice this day... for on this day, we are joined in purpose and vision... we are of a singular heart and mind. On this day, we are one! We are one! We are one! We are one! We are one! We are one!</p>
