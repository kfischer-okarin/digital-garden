## Full-time vs non full-time ministry

> He said to them: I am so excited about you because today is the beginning of your adult life with Christ. It's a different world for you.

> And when he said that my heart just broke for the other 90 % in the room.

> He didn't intend to say it but what he said to them was basically: For you all God has got kind of a secondary plan. You aren't image bearers fully, close maybe but not fully.


## "Moving from success to significance"

> When you work hard in the work place you can handle success but you have also to do something that matters (i.e. matters to God)

## "Kingdom purposes"

Asking a Christian building owner: have you ever thought of using your building for Kingdom purposes

Basically saying what you do most of your time is fine but it's not kingdom purposes

## "We do good things at work but..."

We often talk as if your work didn't have intrinsic value. That's not true. We're image bearers in our job and we don't need to justify anything beyond that.

## "I want to do something purposeful in my job..."

Young people are taught that purpose can only be found in NGOs of professions that are social
