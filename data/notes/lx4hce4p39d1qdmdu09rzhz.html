<p>An example by <a href="/digital-garden/notes/z9gx7moufbtkany03m1q57s">G. K. Chesterton</a> about practicing <a href="/digital-garden/notes/kxj70ew56q2s9ctfokv66xe">Second-Order Thinking</a>.</p>
<p>Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place. Otherwise you might cause unintended
side-effects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate
erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, "I don't see the use of this;
let us clear it away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: "If you don't see the
use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that
you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.</p>
