<h1 id="the-perfect-time-travel-game">The "perfect" time travel game<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-perfect-time-travel-game"></a></h1>
<p>A game with a free form time-travel/manipulation system (think for example D-Mails in Steins;Gate) which you have to
exploit to continue with the story but also work as a sandbox. You could change anything and the chances of you ending
up in a hopeless timeline are not insignificant.</p>
<p>Requirement for that would be a somewhat complete model of causal relationships, so you could calculate the effects of
your time travel.</p>
<p>In order for a story to happen you would also need a model of the main story that is being told and the types of
stories that could occur, the potential dramatic conflicts that build up and might occur - so alternative timelines
could be constructed believably.</p>
<p>It would be maybe something like an AI Dungeon Master with enough knowledge to adjust the world in reaction to the time
manipulation.</p>
<p>There would also need to be a good setting and likeable characters you care about in the first place</p>
