<p>Jacob reconciles with Esau and arrives in Canaan</p>
<ul>
<li>Esau reaches him and Jacob was ready for the worst of worst but contrary to his expectation Esau welcomed him with
tears of joy</li>
<li>Esau doesn't want any of Jacobs reconciliation presents he had sent earlier, but Jacob insists on him taking them</li>
<li>Esau offers to lead him into the country but Jacob rejects the offer since he has many children and young animals that
need to travel slowly and carefully</li>
<li>In the end he settles down in a city called Shechem and bought a piece there</li>
</ul>
