<ul>
<li>User Stories are not extensive complete documentation artifacts</li>
<li>They are conversation starters
<ul>
<li>Write down the short idea of the feature and then go and have a conversation with the involved parties</li>
<li>Have a collaborative visual workspace where you can build and document a common understanding (Whiteboard / Miro)</li>
<li>It's like a holiday photo - you look at them and if you were there that's enough to remember all kinds of things
from the vacation - whereas it doesn't mean a lot to someone who wasn't there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For big stories map them out step by step from the user's point of view</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Those questions map to certain elements of planning
<ul>
<li>Why: Big Picture, your end goal</li>
<li>Who: Who to address</li>
<li>What: What kind of behaviour/change you want to achieve</li>
<li>How: Project Scope</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Answering one question helps answering the neighboring ones</li>
<li>The Big Picture is your Goal in your Navigation system</li>
<li>You can try out many different Who/What/Hows once you know the why
<ul>
<li>The why will give you a way to measure success</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each connection uphill is an assumption
<ul>
<li>Who could help me achieve my goal?</li>
<li>What kind of behaviour in those people might help to achieve that goal?</li>
<li>How to achieve that behaviour change?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>(C)ustomer &#x26; (M)anager</p>
<ul>
<li>C: We want to have levels and achievements for our game.</li>
<li>M: This is a what - How does this change somebody's behavior.</li>
<li>C: I don't understand</li>
<li>M: Imagine we spend 9 months on this and nothing changes in the user's behaviour... have we wasted time?</li>
<li>C: Yes.</li>
<li>M: Ok, let's not do that. So give me an example of how the users will behave differently.</li>
<li>C: They will post to Facebook.</li>
<li>M: They do that already... what's the change?</li>
<li>C: They will post a lot more.
<div class="mermaid">

    Players --- pm(Post More)

</div>
</li>
<li>M: Ok, so if we deliver 10 % of the above and people don't post more we should stop this - if they do we know we're
doing something right. So why is it important for people to post more?</li>
<li>C: If they post more other people might read about our games.</li>
<li>M: That's another behavior change not a big picture. Why is it important that they read about the games?</li>
<li>C: If they read about it they will come and play the games more.</li>
<li>M: That's another behavior change. Why is that important?</li>
<li>C: That's a stupid question
<ul>
<li>When you hear something like that you're onto something good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>M: So you want more players... How many more? Would it be a waste of time if after 9 months you had 5 more players?</li>
<li>C: No, no, no we need 1 million more players
<div class="mermaid">

<ul>
<li>He actually had a problem but came with a solution instead, we just had a structured conversation to unpack the
problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>M: So this is our destination... and these are some of the roads we could take... Let's not take a tunnel for 9 months
but let's try out if this is actually a good idea. Something simple we could quickly do would be allowing people to
post about tournament wins... so we can test the hypothesis about players posting more.
<div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR
    1m(1M Players) --- Players
    Players --- pm(Post More)
    pm --- la(Levels and Achievements)
    pm --- tw(Tournament Winners)
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They tried out tournament winners and after three days no one shared their wins anymore because they didn't want to
spam their friends. So making players post more about a stupid Facebook game doesn't seem to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>M: We could try to make people invite others</li>
<li>C: So here we asked our marketing department and they gave us this:
<div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR
    1m(1M Players) --- Players
    Players --- pm(Post More)
    pm --- la(Levels and Achievements)
    pm --- tw(Tournament Winners)
    Players --- i(Invite more friends)
    i --- Automated
</div>
</li>
<li>M: No you're doing this again... let's first see if this even makes sense... maybe with something manual
<div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR
    1m(1M Players) --- Players
    Players --- pm(Post More)
    pm --- la(Levels and Achievements)
    pm --- tw(Tournament Winners)
    Players --- i(Invite more friends)
    i --- Automated
    i --- Manual
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It didn't work at first, but when they changed the mail template to make the invite button more visible and it actually
helped</p>
