<p>There are many people who are successful and doing well in their life even though they do evil and don't care about God
or any consequences of what they do. We feel often frustrated about that and wonder why God is letting that happen?
But the truth is that God sees everything and in the end the evil people who don't repent will get their fair
punishment. God will restore justice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul,<br>
    and the one greedy for gain curses and renounces the Lord.<br>
In the pride of his face the wicked does not seek him;<br>
    all his thoughts are, “There is no God.”<br>
His ways prosper at all times;<br>
    your judgments are on high, out of his sight;<br>
    as for all his foes, he puffs at them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you do see, for you note mischief and vexation,<br>
    that you may take it into your hands;<br>
to you the helpless commits himself;<br>
    you have been the helper of the fatherless.</p>
