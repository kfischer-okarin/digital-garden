<li>Common interpretations of the story include:

<ul>
<li>Were they just a brotherly society of dedicated builders?</li>
<li>Were they becoming too proud for their own good? With the help of technology?</li>
<li>Did God need to destroy them because they were a threat?</li>
<li>The phrase used for "making bricks" (nilbena levenim) is only used <strong>one</strong> other time in the Bible
<ul>
<li>In Exodus when the pharao forces the Israelites to increase their brick output without giving them straw

<li>Making bricks basically required slave labor in the ancient world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The word for "come" (as in "Come, let us...") (havah) - is like a forceful "Come on!", i.e. forcing something lesser
in power to fulfill your wish as a ruler
<ul>
<li>Other uses are:
<ul>
<li>The pharao wanting to enslave the Israelites <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">reference.bible.exodus.1 (Private)</a></li>
<li>Judah strongly demanding sex from a prostitute in <a href="/digital-garden/notes/bpo8wd2td0g2gjoaqsszbbd">Genesis 38</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The "city fortified up to the skies" is similar in wording like the cities in Canaan that were built by wicked
societies <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">reference.bible.deuteronomy.9 (Private)</a>
<ul>
<li>"impossible" (as in "nothing [...] will now be impossible") is actually also an allusion to the fortified cities
(the Hebrew word yibbatzer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"propose" (as in "nothing that they propose") has a connotation of plotting to pervert justice</li>
<li>So what is described in Genesis 11 is the birth of the first exploitative empire (The Akkadian Empire) in Mesopotamia</li>
<li>The single language was an enforced empire language - a regression from the diversity after the spreading out of the
descendants of Noah in <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">reference.bible.genesis.10 (Private)</a></li>
<li>Wanting to stay in one place (to solidify ones power) was a direct contradiction to God's command before after the
flood "Be fruitful and multiply" in <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">reference.bible.genesis.9 (Private)</a></li>

<ul>
<li>To break up the exploitative society</li>
<li>In the end it was a blessing in disguise - to regain diversity</li>

<h2 id="whats-the-message">What's the message?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#whats-the-message"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>We should abhor injustice</li>
<li>We should embrace the goods of diversity</li>
<li>God is there as a good parent to guide our steps even if we fail at living up to those standards</li>
</ul>
