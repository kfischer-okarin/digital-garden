> Never trust, always verify

## No machine/user is automatically trusted
Always verify access for all resources - as compared to the "castle-and-moat" security model, where once you enter the
private network you can access many/all resources.

## Least-privileged access
Only give the minimal permissions that are necessary for executing the request to limit the damage radius in case a
malicious request was made successfully.

  this until I actually need to study about this more (if ever).
