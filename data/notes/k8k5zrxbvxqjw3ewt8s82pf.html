<ul>
<li>Schechem (the city where Jacob settled in <a href="/digital-garden/notes/49syz34k69qqmsqg5vnqu98">Genesis 33</a> was probably named after him) was attracted
to Jacob's daughter Dinah and rapes her and then asks his father to organize that she should get married to him</li>
<li>His father brings that proposal to Jacob and his sons</li>
<li>The sons deceived him by saying that they would accept the offer if all men in the city would get circumcised and they
accepted, thinking that they would get hold of Jacob's wealth by connecting their families in marriage</li>
<li>Few days later when the men's circumcision wounds were hurting Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, came to the city,
killed every man inside and stole all their women and possessions</li>
<li>Jacob was not very happy about this since they might now be hated by the people of Canaan, but the brothers cared more
about their sister's honor</li>
