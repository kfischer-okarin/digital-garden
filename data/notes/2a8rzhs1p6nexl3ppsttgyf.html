<p>(3) When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,<br>
the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,<br>
(4) what is man that you are mindful of him,<br>
and the son of man that you care for him?</p>

<p>Looking at the whole huge universe (the size of which we probably don't even begin to grasp), how great and powerful
must the being that made all of this be?</p>

<li><strong>Epistemic Status:</strong> One of my personal convictions as a Christian, contentwise yet a work in progress. Greatness
is also maybe not the best word, but I need to understand the often used term "glory" better before I can use it with
