## Keeping a personal blog / Incremental Correctness

Not everything we produce has to be perfect and final when we put it out there into the world. All classical
distribution (like blogs) mechanisms don't really encourage updating and re-working...

- Quoting from Brian Lovin's article
[Incrementally correct personal websites](https://brianlovin.com/writing/incrementally-correct-personal-websites)
which describes this concept in detail.

> Incremental correctness is the process of iterating towards something more truthful, accurate, usable, or
interesting. The faster we can iterate, the faster we can discover good ideas. Things aren't perfect today, but
tomorrow things can be slightly closer to perfect.
>
> Incremental correctness changes everything about the way you work. It's anti-perfectionism. It's pro-generation. It's
about discovery and proof, research and prototyping, and having a framework to reliably test your instincts. It
discourages major redesigns, preferring isolated improvements to a small subset of nodes in any kind of working tree.

## Taking notes during creative work
- Take notes, leave a record of your thought and development process to know how you got where you are.
- Ideas that are just in your head will eventually disappear uselessly
  - Be always prepared to show your work, having legible and clear notes is one part of that
