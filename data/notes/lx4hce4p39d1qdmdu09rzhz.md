# Chesterton's Fence

An example by [[reference.authors.g-k-chesterton]] about practicing [[concepts.misc.second-order-thinking]].

Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place. Otherwise you might cause unintended
side-effects.

## The original quote
> There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate
  erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, "I don't see the use of this;
  let us clear it away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: "If you don't see the
  use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that
  you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.
