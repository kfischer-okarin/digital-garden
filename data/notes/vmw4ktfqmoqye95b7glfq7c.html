<ul>
<li>First 5 months: outreach, outreach, outreach. Get the reps in.</li>

<li>Once I landed a few clients, reworked my profile &#x26; add new skills.</li>
<li>Raised my hourly rate every 2-3 new clients.</li>
<li>Asked for reviews.</li>
<li>Low-hanging fruit:
<ul>
<li>In the beginning, I didn’t care how small the project was. I wanted to deliver results, get reviews, and keep
growing.</li>
</ul>

<li>My strategy was:
<ul>
<li>Once someone works with me, they get the results they expected, they will be happy, and I will be happy.</li>
</ul>
