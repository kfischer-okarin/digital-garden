<p>Battling an overfilled inbox?
Your ever-lengthening to-do lists?
Struggling against distraction?
What if you tried to stop doing everything, so you could finally get round to what counts?</p>
<p>If you live to 80, you'll have barely more than four thousand weeks on earth. How will you decide how to spend them?</p>
<p>Rejecting the futile modern obsession with 'getting everything done,' Four Thousand Weeks introduces readers to tools
for constructing a meaningful life by embracing rather than denying their limitations.</p>
<p>Drawing on the insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual teachers, Oliver
Burkeman sets out to realign our relationship with time - and in doing so, to liberate us from its tyranny.</p>
