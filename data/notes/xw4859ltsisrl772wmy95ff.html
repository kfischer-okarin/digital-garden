// - `Mutex` type provides thread-safe access to the data.
//   Since r2d2 allows multiple threads to use the same connection pool, and each connection may be used by different
//   threads at different times, it is important to ensure that concurrent access to the data does not cause data races
//   or corruption. The Mutex type provides a lock-based synchronization mechanism that ensures only one thread can
//   access the data at a time.
// - The `Arc` provides shared ownership of the data.
//   Since r2d2 allows connections to be cloned and returned to the pool when they are dropped, it is important to
//   ensure that the data is not dropped prematurely when one of the clones goes out of scope. The Arc type provides a
//   reference-counted pointer that keeps track of how many owners there are for the data and only drops it when there
//   are no more owners left.

<ul>
<li><code>Mutex</code> type provides thread-safe access to the data
Since r2d2 allows multiple threads to use the same connection pool, and each connection may be used by different
threads at different times, it is important to ensure that concurrent access to the data does not cause data races or
corruption. The Mutex type provides a lock-based synchronization mechanism that ensures only one thread can access the
data at a time.</li>
<li>The <code>Arc&#x3C;Mutex&#x3C;HashMap&#x3C;String, String>>></code> type wraps the Mutex in an Arc to provide shared ownership of the data. Since r2d2 allows connections to be cloned and returned to the pool when they are dropped, it is important to ensure that the data is not dropped prematurely when one of the clones goes out of scope. The Arc type provides a reference-counted pointer that keeps track of how many owners there are for the data and only drops it when there are no more owners left.</li>
</ul>
<p>These choices allow us to implement a simple and safe in-memory connection manager for r2d2 that can handle concurrent and dynamic usage patterns.</p>
