<ul>
<li>What is your core theme?
<ul>
<li>The story's truth</li>
<li>What change would you like to see in the world?</li>
<li>What is the truth that you want to scream from the rooftops?</li>
<li>This drives your whole story... this is why you care about the story</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Turn the theme into the opposite - into a lie... this is the core misbelief</li>
<li>What could have happened in the character's past to make them believe such a thing?
<ul>
<li>Can be a traumatic event... Can be a slow dripping continuous impact that makes a hole into the sone</li>
<li>Children until 7 years old believe almost everything - their brain is still forming</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write that pivotal scene! It will help you understand that character's thought process... internal workings...
<ul>
<li>This is the motive driving the goal of the character</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write more other scenes that cement the character's misbelief
<ul>
<li>Situations where they were challenged and had the chance to step out and discover the truth - but instead chose the
lie - and cemented their belief</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How is my character dissatisfied with their life today because of their firm belief into that lie?</li>
<li>What does my character think will make them happy? (based on their misbelief?)
<ul>
<li>This is their goal that will drive he plot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What steps could my character take now to actively pursue this goal?
<ul>
<li>This becomes the plot - driven by the character!</li>
