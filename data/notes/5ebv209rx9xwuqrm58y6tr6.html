<ul>
<li>Two years after the cupbearer was released the Pharao began had two dreams: 7 fat cows followed by 7 thin cows who
devoured them and the same dream with 7 fat ears of grain eaten by 7 thin ears.</li>
<li>The cupbearer remembered Joseph and told the Pharao about him and Joseph was taken out of prison</li>
<li>He told him the message that God wanted the Pharao to know through this dreams, namely that 7 years of abundance would
come followed by 7 years of famine and that Egypt needs to prepare for this</li>
<li>Pharao decided to let Joseph handle this since he seems to have great wisdom and he made him second in authority over
Egypt</li>
<li>He was also given the daughter of an important priest as wife. She gave birth to Manasse and Ephraim who should become
heirs of Israel later
<ul>
<li>So part of Israel is actually half-Egyptian in heritage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The events predicted by the dream came true and Joseph stored the surplus of grain in the 7 abundant years</li>
<li>Then the famine years came and Joseph began to sell the stored grain to the Egyptians and also to foreigners</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you
that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” Joseph answered Pharaoh, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a
favorable answer.”</p>

affliction.”</p>
