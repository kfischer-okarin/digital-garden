# God is the one who changes hearts

> Create in me a clean heart, O God,<br/>
> and renew a right spirit within me.

[Psalm 51:10](https://esv.org/Psalm51:10) #bible.psalm.051

David wrote this as part of the psalm he wrote after one of the biggest mistakes he ever made in his life. He knew
that he himself cannot produce a right heart attitude that is pleasing to God.
