# 10 Problems to get started

Source: https://mobile.twitter.com/0xbnomial/status/1523256409529667584

## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This is the perfect project to get started with classification algorithms.

It will teach you some data engineering practices, and you can solve it with a simple decision tree.

## House Prices

Now that you understand classification problems, it's time to look into regression.

Here you'll predict the price of a house given its characteristics.

## Wine Quality

Another classic problem where you can explore regression and classification algorithms is the Wine Quality challenge.

https://kaggle.com/rajyellow46/wine-quality

A great candidate to reaffirm what you've learned so far.

## Mall Customer Segmentation Data

Now it's time to look into Unsupervised Learning techniques, and this dataset is a great start:

Your goal here is to determine which customers are a good target for your marketing department.

## Digit Recognizer

This is the "Hello World" of Computer Vision, so you want to start here before getting any deep.

https://kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

You'll learn how to "read" images to determine the specific digit they show.

## Dogs vs. Cats

After getting the hang of neural networks, you can upgrade to a more complex Computer Vision problem: the Dogs vs. Cats dataset.

https://kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats

Your goal is simple: does the input picture show a dog or a cat?

## Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn

As soon as you want to get into Natural Language Processing, this is a great problem to pick up:

Here you'll be doing sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews.

## The Walmart Challenge

Time series analysis is another big area covered by Machine Learning, and the Walmart dataset will get you started.

https://kaggle.com/bletchley/course-material-walmart-challenge

Here you will be predicting Walmart's weekly sales based on past data.


## The Movies Dataset

Do you want to build a recommendation system (similar to what Netflix does)? You can start here:

Recommendation systems are very useful and have multiple applications.

## Open Images 2019 - Object Detection

I wanted to end the list with another extremely useful application of Computer Vision: Object Detection.

https://kaggle.com/c/open-images-2019-object-detection

Here you have 9 million images to play with.
