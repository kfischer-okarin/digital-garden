# Tips from an producer

## Pick a deadline

Nothing motivates you more than time running out.

Indie dev is HARD & a million variables will try stop you from progressing. Set a date you think is realistic & do your
best to reach it.

You can always adjust, but you need to keep moving forward to a goal

## Share your work

Sometimes the endorphins you get from posting your work and people liking it is what will get you to the next milestone.

You can build a community before you launch, test your ideas, potentially go viral & get support.

No one is going to steal your idea

## Know your audience

The harsh reality is that marketing is 50% of the job. Picking a genre and understanding the kinds of games your
players like is key. Know the competitors and what is currently trending.

Your game can be great but timing & positioning is really important

## Failure is the process

Your first game might not be a hit, but your fourth might be a remix of a system you made in your second and be the
same genre as your first. As long as you're learning, the time is not wasted.

Make sure to publish/record your unfinished work too

## Keep it simple

All it takes is an interesting game mechanic, and clear game loop to succeed. Players don't need anything complex, and
in most cases the simpler the concept the better and easier it is to communicate.

Make sure the title, branding & tutorial is cohesive

## Write it down

Get into the habit of writing down your thoughts and ideas when you're out and about, as solutions might pop up at any
time.

Tasking is also important to break down complex systems into actionable chunks, use sticky notes and focus on one task
at a time

## Be different

Is your game something that has been done before? What sets it apart? What makes it interesting? Are you using emerging
technology, or combining 2 genres in a new way?

Know what sets you apart and what will help to sell your game to new people that stumble on it

## Have fun

At the end of the day your passion and curiosity is what will get you through & make an impact. Make sure you are
enjoying the process and letting your heart guide your decisions.

It will be hard at times, but making a game that someone enjoys will bring immense joy

## Bonus Tip: Take care of yourself

- Sleeping an adequate amount of time
- As well as eating healthily
- exercising regularly ðŸ‘Œ
