# Romans 1

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1&version=ESV)

## My Summary

- Paul introduces himself as an apostle
  - His message about Jesus, the gospel of God, was predicted by the prophets and approved by the resurrection
  - He speaks about his burden he feels to bring the gospel to the Gentiles
- He praises the Romans for their faith and expresses his sadness that he couldn't visit them
- He starts explaining the gospel:
  - Right in the beginning he clarifies: The Gospel can save anyone by faith!
  - Everyone knows about God, it can be clearly perceived from nature
  - But humans don't worship God but created things instead
  - So God gave them up to all kinds of sins


## Central verses
> For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew
  first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written,
  “The righteous shall live by faith.”

[Romans 1:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A16-17&version=ESV)

> For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes,
  namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in
  the things that have been made. So they are without excuse

[Romans 1:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A19-20&version=ESV)
