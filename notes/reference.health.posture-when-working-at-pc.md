# Posture When Working at PC

- Screen at eye level
- Shoulders back and down
- Knees and elbows at 90 degree
- Chair should have lumbar (lower spine) support and head rest if possible to support the natural shape of the spine
  - I use Ergohuman PRO https://www.ergohuman.jp/product/ergohuman_pro.php
- Get up regularly (every 30-60 minutes) and walk around
