<h2 id="my-summary">My Summary<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#my-summary"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>We read the Bible with certain preconceptions - things that go without being said - and that influences how we
understand the texts - which were written in a different culture than ours</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-1---serving-two-masters-mores">Chapter 1 - Serving Two Masters (Mores)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chapter-1---serving-two-masters-mores"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>More - A fundamental moral view of a group</li>
<li>If we are conflicted with a conflicting more we can either stubbornly resist or compromise (not necessarily negative)</li>
<li>Westeners tend to see things dualistically - something is either right or wrong, true or false, good or bad</li>
<li>Even among Christians mores can greatly differ
<ul>
<li>Cussing and swearing is a no go in many parts of the US</li>
<li>Playing cards was not ok in the South of the US but becomes OK towards the north</li>
<li>Smoking is ok on the East Coast (where tobacco is grown) and becomes more and more unaccepable towards the west</li>
<li>Theater going was seen as very sinful in the past but became more accepted and sermons became more theatrical too</li>
<li>Playing billard is seen as very sinful among some Indonesian Christians</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Because of that we might interpret Biblical stories differently, like Sodom and Gomorrah
<ul>
<li>For Westerners the sin is obviously sodomy</li>
<li>For Indonesians it's inhospitality, they use Ezekiel 16:49 as support
<blockquote>
<p>Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did
not help the poor and needy.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For Westerners marriage (and sex within marriage) is preferable to singleness (and celibacy)
<ul>
<li>In India where the apostle Thomas preached the Gospel according to tradition, the message of celibacy was eagerly
received since they were already influenced by Hinduism's ascetism</li>
<li>We would think it a misapplication of the gospel to talk an engaged couple out of marriage - but is that really so?</li>
<li>The Bible calls both marriage and singleness good - none is itself better than the other</li>
<li>Paul was considering Roman mores about sexual morality in <a href="/digital-garden/notes/cilck7sw76875knqx7qkpx6">1 Corinthians 7</a>

<li>Paul was undermining Roman mores about human sexuality. Roman women were supposed to marry as early as possible and
focus on childbearing and men were practically expected to commit adultery. Paul's teaching is granting liberty to
women and placing moral restrictions on men at that time. (Source <a href="/digital-garden/notes/sofg3p2jgof8lmhz9xq94d4">Misreading Scripture with Western Eyes</a>, Chapter 1)</li>
</ul>
</div></div><p></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Westerners consider wealth an unlimited resource which can be accumulated without moral problems if you are successful
enough
<ul>
<li>Many would even go so far and say if you don't have wealth then it's because you're lazy and not determined enough</li>
<li>In non Western cultures wealth is seen as limited and you live at the expense of others when you're rich
<ul>
<li>There's no good reason to accumulate more than you need and thus destroy others</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We Westerners tend to misread lessons about economic &#x26; social modesty as lessons about sexual modesty
<ul>
<li>Paul's admonition to women in 1 Cor 11 to cover their hair

<li>The admonition to cover their head was because Corinthian women wore their hair open when they went to to dinner
parties (convivia) where several immoral activities took place: "Escorts", idol meat, adultery, drunkenness (All
topics mention in 1 Corinthian 6-11). Covering their hair was not a matter sexual modesty - just of modesty in
general.</li>
</ul>
</div></div><p></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In 18th century New England people rented pews with their tithes... the social and financial hierarchy was clearly
on display inside the church</li>
<li>Are we acting economically modest on Sundays? Do we display status and riches in the way we dress or display luxury
goods to others around us?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Different cultures have different "culturally edible" food
<ul>
<li>In Indonesia there's dog and rat meat, and they find the thought of us taking baby cow food and letting it go bad
until it molds - cheese - appalling</li>
<li>For people growing up with certain cultural mores about food, this is not just a theological debate or a small thing
<ul>
<li>Asking a orthodox Jew or a Muslim to eat pork could be as repulsive as asking Westerners to eat cockroaches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This has practical implications too - how could a Jew share a table with someone whose breath stank of pig fat?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can we avoid these kind of instinctive interpretations distorting our interpretation of a Bible text?
<ul>
<li>When looking at a text go through these steps:
<ul>
<li>Clearly this passage is saying .... is right/wrong?</li>
<li>Is this really what is condemned?</li>
<li>Am I adding/removing elements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for clues in the text: Repeated words</li>
<li>Read Bible texts with Christians from other cultures</li>
<li>Read books of Christians from other cultures or time periods</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>White children are more expensive to adopt in the US than children of color - even in Christian adoption agencies</li>
<li>Nowadays Western culture starts to be "colorblind"
<ul>
<li>Since we don't want to make value statements about ethnicities - we hesitate to make any statements or distinctions
at all</li>
<li>We want to make things simple by believing that ethnic differences don't matter at all - effectively that will mean
that we believe that everyone should be treated as members of the majority culture</li>
<li>But that is naive and can result in serious misunderstanding - There are differences in dialect, worship style,
dress, cuisine, prejudices etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For first century Romans it was totally fine to say: "He does such-and-such because he is a Jew"</li>
