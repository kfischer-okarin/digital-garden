## What is XP?
- Getting over our own surety that "I know better than everyone else and all I need is to be left alone to be the
  greatest"
- XP = Stay aware, adapt, change
- Everything in software changes, we must be able to cope with change

## Values, Practices, Principles
- Practices: Specific, concrete things you do day to day
  - can have benefits even if you don't share values or understand principles behind them
- Values: Why you do things, purpose of practices
  - practices are evidence of values, they bring accountability
  - Master craftsmen know what's really valuable by experience
- Principles: Domain specific guidelines for life
  - Connecting values and practices

## Values of XP
- Value 1: Communication
  - Talk to people, they might have had a similarly problem before already
  - When a problem happens ask yourself
    - Was it caused by lack of communication?
    - What communication can I take now to address it?
    - What communication can you take in the future to avoiding getting into the same problem again?
- Value 2: Simplicity
  - > What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?
