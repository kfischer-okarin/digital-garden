## My Summary

## What is XP?
- Getting over our own surety that "I know better than everyone else and all I need is to be left alone to be the
  greatest"
- XP = Stay aware, adapt, change
- Everything in software changes, we must be able to cope with change

## Values, Practices, Principles
- Practices: Specific, concrete things you do day to day
  - can have benefits even if you don't share values or understand principles behind them
- Values: Why you do things, purpose of practices
  - practices are evidence of values, they bring accountability
  - Master craftsmen know what's really valuable by experience
- Principles: Domain specific guidelines for life
  - Connecting values and practices

## Values of XP
- Value 1: Communication
  - Talk to people, they might have had a similarly problem before already
  - When a problem happens ask yourself
    - Was it caused by lack of communication?
    - What communication can I take now to address it?
    - What communication can you take in the future to avoiding getting into the same problem again?
- Value 2: Simplicity
  - > What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?
  - Improving communication can improve Simplicity by removing unneeded or not yet needed requirements
  - Improving simplicity improves Communication since there's less to communicate about
- Value 3: Feedback
  - We don't know what is the "right" way to build things from the beginning - we need constant feedback
  - Types of feedback
    - opinions about an idea
    - how the code looks
    - whether tests are easy to write
    - how it works
  - Generate as quick and much feedback as you can handle
  - if you can't handle feedback quickly enough you need to fix that first
- Value 4: Courage
  - Effective action in the face of fear
    - speak truths pleasant or unpleasant to foster communication and trust
    - discard failing solutions to get simplicity
    - seek real concrete answers to get feedback
    - not acting even though it seems serious and urgent to get to the foundation of an issue
- Value 5: Respect
  - caring for the other team members, the project and their work
  - everyone on the team is important
