# Tips from Twitter People

- I write a list of all the things I need to do and a list of all the things I want to do, and I do a fun one first
  followed by a work one, and so on. This method kick starts the day with a fun thing, then rewards me for doing boring
  tasks by getting to do more fun things!
- Having less time available makes me more productive. Getting temp office work has given me the structure and urgency
  I need to fit in my freelance and personal projects, which I was struggling to get done when I had the whole day at
  home.
- You need to _embrace_ the things that are fun and interesting, not try focus on the hard stuff first.
- ‚ÄúMake the consequence hurt more.‚Äù has never motivated me, it just makes the consequence hurt more. üôÉ Instead, I try
  to make consequences light, but drum up the urgency with timers, public accountability, etc.
- I determine when is "The absolute last second" I can start a project and have it done on time.
- Reward yourself before doing something not after. Our brains don't really believe in the future.
- Follow the distractions! This is how I get tons of work done both for my job and at home. Sometimes, it's not the
  worst thing to just allow yourself to be distracted by things (within reason) and go with the flow of it. If it's
  truly urgent it will come up again
- Inspiration is perishable, so following immediate ‚Äúdistractions‚Äù can lead to great productivity; just not necessarily
  in the direction you might have planned, or expected. Stay agile, and see where it takes you.
- Sometimes I do a "Ta da!" list where I just write down things I've already done and check them off. Makes the list a
  lot less intimidating when most of the things are checked off.
- Stay up super late if it means you‚Äôre going to finish something. Because once you get out of the zone, it‚Äôs so hard
  to get back in!
- Compartmentalize. ADHD sufferers get hit with executive dysfunction REALLY easily. Not just because a job is huge,
  but because it contains a dozen other jobs we might find ourselves being pulled into.
- I make everything ritualistic so I never have to DECIDE to do something.
  Every Tuesday I go grocery shopping.
  Every Friday I put gas in my car.
  Every Sunday I do laundry.
  When I turn off the lights at night, I put new coffee grounds in the pot.
  Every time.
