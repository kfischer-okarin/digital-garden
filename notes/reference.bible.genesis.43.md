# Genesis 43

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+43&version=ESV)

## My Summary
- Joseph's brother convince their father to let them go again and to take Benjamin with them since the Egyptian
  minister would not welcome them if they came back without him
- Jacob gives them honey, nuts, almonds and other valuable things and the money they had found after their last trip
  in addition to the normal payment
- Joseph after he had to cry in secret when he saw Benjamin again, welcomed them with a big feast, arranged seats for
  them in their age order and gave Benjamin five times as much food as everyone else

## Central verses for me
> And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother,
  of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!” Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm
  for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there. Then he washed his face
  and came out. And controlling himself he said, “Serve the food.”
