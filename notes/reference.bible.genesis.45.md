# Genesis 45

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+45&version=ESV)

## My Summary
- Joseph cannot hold it longer and reveals himself to his brothers
- They are reluctant but he can convince them that he means them no harm and that all of this was God's plan to save
  many people from the draught`
- The Pharao wants them to move to Egypt with their father and their whole family
- Joseph sends them home with gifts and they convince Jacob to come with them to Egypt

## Central verses for me
> â€œI am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because
  you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.

[Genesis 45:4b-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+45%3A4-5&version=ESV)

> So it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler
  over all the land of Egypt.

[Genesis 45:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+45%3A8&version=ESV)
