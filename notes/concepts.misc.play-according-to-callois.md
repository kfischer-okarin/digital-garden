# Play According to Callois

Play is:
- voluntary
- separate from daily life and activities
- uncertain, the outcome depends on luck/player actions
- not generating economic benefit
- has rules that override players ordinary behaviours
- involved with some imagined reality

Play combines one or more of four elements
- Competition
- Chance
- Roleplaying/Simulation
- Vertigo: Experiencing strong emotions or sensations as part of play

It can also be arranged on an axis between
- Paidia: Uncontrolled fantasy, spontaneous play and improvisation
- Ludus: Needs effort, patience, skill or ingenuity. The game was designed before playing

## Examples
- Sports: Competition + Ludus
- Chess: Competition + Ludus
- Slot Machines: Change + Ludus
- Table Top RPG: Roleplaying + Both Ludus & Paidia (depending on system & playstyle)
