# Genesis 39

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+39&version=ESV)

## My Summary
- Joseph arrives in the house of Potiphar, an officer of the Pharao, and Potiphar quickly realized that God blessed
  everything that Joseph did so he entrusted almost everything to him
- Potiphar's wife tries to seduce Joseph, who was a good-looking man, but he rejects her
- Her final assault is not successful either but she takes his clothes from him and uses them to accuse him falsely of
  a rape/seduction attempt
- Potiphar believes his wife and throws Joseph into prison
- In prison Joseph again gains the trust of his overseer because of his good work and God blessing him and he was
  entrusted all kinds of work in the prison
