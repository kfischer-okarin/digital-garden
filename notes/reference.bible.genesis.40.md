# Genesis 39

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+40&version=ESV)

## My Summary
- The chief cupbearer and the chief baker of the Pharao are put into prison and Joseph cares for them
- One night each of them had a dream they didn't understand - and next morning when they seemed depressed Joseph asked
  them what was wrong
- Joseph told them that God would know the interpretation of their dreams and asked them to tell him the dreams
- The cupbearer had a dream about three vine branches bearing fruit and him pouring their wine into the Pharao's cup
  - Joseph interpreted: In three days he would return to the court of the Pharao in three days
  - Joseph also asks him to not forget him and tell the Pharao about his unfair treatment
- The baker had a dream about three baskets of cake out of which birds ate
  - Joseph interpreted: In three days he would be hanged
- It all came true but the cupbearer forgot about Joseph
