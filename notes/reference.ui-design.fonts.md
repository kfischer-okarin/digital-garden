## How to find great fonts
- Check the fonts of great designs
- Have a collection of great fonts
- [[Tools for Finding Font Pairings|reference.tools-for.finding-font-pairings]]

### Some Recommendations
- Fira Sans: clean/simple with a side of warmth/humanity
- Inter: Un-opinionated and readable. If I found myself thinking “Man, I really want to use Helvetica here”,
- Clear Sans
  - squared-off feel, brands that are data-driven, scientific, masculine, or authoritative
- Source Sans Pro
  - neutral character, just a touch of humanist warmth, works great for user interfaces
  - Has partner fonts: Source Serif, Source Code Pro (monospace) - but stands well on its own
- PT Serif: more formal, knowledgeable, academic, official, or authoritative settings

## Size
- Not all font sizes work together well, use the calculator below to find sizes that work well together
