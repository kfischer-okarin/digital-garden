# Stellaris

## Building Species
- Roleplaying Style
  - Make up a kind of species you like to be
- Min Max Style
  - Totally focus on one thing with traits and civics (e.g. Engineering research)
- Random Species
- Challenge Run

## Exploration
- 2-4 Science ships in the beginning
- Research only anomalies at most 1 level above the scientist
- If you need to expand quick, Leave anomalies in the beginning and focus on finding your neighbors
- Capture chokepoint systems
  - Keeping neutral dangers alive in those systems can be a good defense

## Traditions
- usually Discovery / Expansion is good in the beginning
- Expansion is good for grabbing new space - good for more aggressive play
- Ascension Perks
  - Technological Ascendancy is a good first one
- Supremacy and Unyielding (DLC) are good for fighting

## Research
- Material sciences is a good focus in the beginning
- Recommended Techs
  - Powered Exoskeletons -> Robotics
  - Planetary Unification
  - Flat research bonuses first
  - Also getting Population growth is usually good
  - Destroyer
  - Starhold

## Planet Management
- Remove blockers to have more population growth
  - You can remove blockers during colonizing!
- Good first buildings: Gene Clininics, Robot Factory
- Clerks are not very good
- Designations
  - Urban World is good because it reduces building upkeep (including special resources for advanced buildings)
  - Mining World not only boosts mining but also Special Resources
  - Factory/Forge world forces industry districts to only have jobs of their type instead of 1 Artisan and 1
    Metallurgist
  - Tech World Designation is quite useless: Researcher upkeep is too little to be worth it, better boost your secondary
  infrastructure on Research worlds
- Don't build more than you need/can work
  - But: New Colonies have high immigration pull (until 10 pops) so it's might be worth to have 5-6 open jobs
- Districts
  - City / Industry is unlimited
  - other districts depend on features
  - It's good to specialize planets
- Jobs
  - Don't produce too many specialist/ruler jobs since pops will promote themselves readily but will only very slowly
    demote themselves again

## Starbases
- Have Hydroponic Farms where ever possible

## Policies
- Liberation Wars allows you to wage war to change an enemy ethic
- Expansionist is not so good actually - Cooperative is better once you have a neighbor and want to be friendly with
  them
- Economic policy gives you either an advantage in consumer goods or in alloys

## Factions
- Promote one easy to please faction with a good presidential candidate

## Trade
- Trade value is collected from Starports with tradehubs (1 Range per tradehub) - or from same system without anything
- Trade policy decides what Trade Value is being converted into
- Trade routes attract pirates which can be kept away with fleets patrolling along the route


## War
- Build lots of Defense platforms at chokepoints
- Put your ships at the front line before war
- Defensive buildings - all of them are good but Disruption field generator
- Claim systems to get the Conquer War Goal
- Ways to end a war
  - War exhaustion reaches 100% - other party can decide the terms of the peace
  - Achieve all war goals
  - Surrender
  - Make a settlement of the current status quo
- Tactics
  - Don't move your fleet in node systems where enemies could come from many sides - let a science ship go there first
    to explore
- After war there will be definitely 10 years of peace and open borders
- If you set Ground Army vessels to aggressive stance they will follow your naval vessels and automatically conquer
  planets if they think they can win
- If you incorporate new species/planets
  - Make sure to build precinct houses to decrease crime
  - Give them only residence rights if their ethics are too different so they cannot have too much political influence
  - Suppress factions with contrary ethics

## Ship design
- You need better power first before you can use better shields
- Usually it's good to have a good mix of armor and shield
- Try to get power down to 0

## Influence
- Have close to maximum of your fleet capacity to get maximum power projection influence (basically trading upkeep for
  higher influence)
- Have rivalries with unfriendly empires to get more influence!!!

## Elections
- Your leaders with high levels are tend to be chosen as candidates which will the scientists in many cases...
