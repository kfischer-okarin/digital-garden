# Stellaris

## Exploration
- 2-4 Science ships in the beginning
- Leave anomalies in the beginning and focus on finding your neighbors
- Capture chokepoint systems
  - Keeping neutral dangers (alive in those systems can be a good defense

## Traditions
- usually Discovery / Expansion is good in the beginning
- Expansion is good for grabbing new space - good for more aggressive play
- Ascension Perks
  - Technological Ascendancy is a good first one

## Research
- Material sciences is a good focus in the beginning
- Get flat research bonuses first
- Also getting Population growth is usually good

## Planet Management
- Don't build more than you need/can work
  - Have 2-5 available jobs on a planet ready for growing pops
- Districts
  - City / Industry is unlimited
  - other districts depend on features
  - It's good to specialize planets
- Jobs
  - Don't produce too many specialist/ruler jobs since pops will promote themselves readily but will only very slowly
    demote themselves again

## Policies
- Economic policy gives you either an advantage in consumer goods or in alloys

## Trade
- Trave value is collected from Starports with tradehubs (1 Range per tradehub) - or from same system without anything
- Trade policy decides what Trade Value is being converted into
- Trade routes attract pirates which can be kept away with fleets patrolling along the route
