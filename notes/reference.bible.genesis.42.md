# Genesis 42

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+42&version=ESV)

## My Summary
- Jacob and his sons were also suffering from the famine and when Jacob heard that there was grain to buy in Egypt
  he sent his sons (except his youngest one, Benjamin) there to buy some
- Joseph's brothers didn't recognize him but he recognized them
- He treated them harshly to test them and see what kind of men they had become in the past years. He demanded that they
  bring their youngest brother to Egypt
- Then he kept Simeon as a prisoner and send the others home with their grain and also secretly returned their money to
  them
- At home though Jacob does not allow them to return and take Benjamin with them

## Central verses
> Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers
came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground. [...] And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had
dreamed of them.‚Äù
