## Alignment

- Design = Alignment
- You don't have to use a single line but still things are aligned to each other

## Spacing

- Space inside groups less than space between groups

## Placement of UI Controls - Locality!
- Put UI controls on where they effect the change
  - Delete button **on** the email it deletes
- Put UI Controls that act on a group of elements in an area above those elements
  - Search bar on top of page searches the whole page
  - Checkbox over table will select all rows

## Alternatives to separating with lines
- Using whitespace (see [Placement of UI Controls - Locality!](#placement-of-ui-controls---locality))
- Using background color to highlight something
- Using shadows to separate elements

## USE LOTS OF WHITESPACE

## Everything should be visible in proportion to its importance
- Borders of a table are less important than the information inside

## Table Design tips
- Make table lines less visible
- Combine columns
  - But only if you don't need to sort separately by those pieces of information
  - Works well with columns where most rows don't have an interesting value
- Don't use colored text - but rather a tag like appearance
- Right-align and monospace number columns for easier comparability

## Use great images

- Free high quality stock photos

  - https://www.pexels.com/

## "Frame breaking" can be interesting
Letting an image outside of its frame like
- a mountain top extending over the menu bar
- A logo/an illustration disappearing partly behind photo elements

Basically letting the photo world and the design element/illustion world overlap

## Light comes from the sky
- Top of things are bright, Shadows are cast below them
  - Checkboxes are darker than the surrounding part and cast shadows

  - Content cards are brighter than the background
  - Input fields are darker than the surrounding surface

## Design Motifs
- Use a common theme/motif throughout your design to make it more interesting
  - Hexagonal logo and a triangle grid over the main page image
  - Use the same color or color gradient across the site

## Tiny Underlines
- Tiny underlines make otherwise boring text more interesting

## Good "No Result" pages
- Give you an action you could take to add the missing data
- Give you the option to remove filters if any are applied
- Show example/popular searches to show the kinds of things they can search for
- Possibly also do fuzzy matching to offer a "Did you mean... ?"

## Don't use obvious labels
- "Description" can stand without label if the text style is clear enough
- Titles/Names can just be headings
- Think about using tag-like displays

## Avoid Dropdowns if possible
- Dropdowns require two clicks and hide the possible options
- Possible replacements:
  - Some Type selection that changes the form -> Tab
  - Date/Time -> Use text fields with date/time pickers
  - Boolean values -> Toggles

## Example design guidelines/directions/motif/brand feel

### Playfulness
- Pastel colors (i.e. less saturation and more brightness)
- Scattered elements in the background (to break up the "grid")
- Fonts with imperfect kerning (space between letters) or stroke-weights make things quirky

### Friendly Design
- Squishy shapes, rounded corners
- Cheerful bright pastel colors
- Font: Simple geometric forms, rounded, not much difference in stroke weight
  - 45 degree terminals (the ends of the c) convey subtle friendliness

### Fancy/Elegant designs
- Thin stroke, crisp corner icons/images
- Grayscale, gold, black colors
- Font: Delicate serif
  - For sans-serif: near vertical terminals (the ends of the c) convey subtle elegance

### Crisp, clear cut impression
- Font: horizontal terminals (the ends of the c) convey subtle crispness
