# Psalm 11

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+11&version=ESV)

## My Summary
- People who do evil think they can do anything and no one ever stops them
- But God sees everything and in the end justice will prevail

## Central verses for me
> For the Lord is righteous;<br/>
  he loves righteous deeds;<br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; the upright shall behold his face.
[Psalm 11:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+11%3A7&version=ESV)
