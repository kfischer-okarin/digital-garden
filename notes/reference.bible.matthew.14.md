# Matthew 14

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+14&version=ESV)

## My Summary
- Herod the tetrarch when he hears of Jesus' deeds thinks that he is John the Baptist who has risen from the dead
- Then the story of how he had John the Baptist killed is told
  - John had critized him for taking his brother's wife Herodias for himself
  - On Herod's birthday the daughter of Herodias danced beautifully and Herod promised before everyone present to give
    her anything she wishes
  - After discussing with her mother she demands the head of John the Baptist and even though Herod really doesn't want
    to kill him he gives in to the pressure since he had promised her
- Jesus crosses the sea to be alone and rest but the crowd follows him
  - He has compassion with them and feeds 5000 men & their women and children with just 5 breads and 2 fish
- (Todo second half)

## Central verses for me
> When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
