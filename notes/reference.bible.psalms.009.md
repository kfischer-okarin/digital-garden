# Psalm 9

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+9&version=ESV)

## My Summary

Praise to God because he brings justice.

- Evil people, those who oppose God and oppress others, will be judged by God
- You can always find shelter and protection with God

## Central verses

> The Lord is a stronghold for the oppressed,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; a stronghold in times of trouble.<br>
  And those who know your name put their trust in you,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; for you, O Lord, have not forsaken those who seek you.

[Psalm 9:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+9%3A9-10&version=ESV)

> The wicked shall return to Sheol,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; all the nations that forget God.<br>
  For the needy shall not always be forgotten,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; and the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.

[Psalm 9:17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+9%3A17-18&version=ESV)
