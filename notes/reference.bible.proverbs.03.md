# Proverbs 3

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+3&version=ESV)

## My Summary

- Be faithful and loving to others, help them immediately when you can
- Lean on God as most fundamental support not on your own wisdom or knowledge
- Honor God with the firstfruits of your work
- Pursue (God's) wisdom and you will without fear
- There's no need to envy people who do evil, God will give them what's due in time
  - And obviously don't do or plan evil yourself

## Central verses for me
> Trust in the Lord with all your heart,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; and do not lean on your own understanding.<br>
  In all your ways acknowledge him,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; and he will make straight your paths.

[Proverbs 3:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+3%3A5-6&version=ESV)
