## My Summary
- We read the Bible with certain preconceptions - things that go without being said - and that influences how we
  understand the texts - which were written in a different culture than ours

---

## Chapter 1 - Serving Two Masters (Mores)
- More - A fundamental moral view of a group
- If we are conflicted with a conflicting more we can either stubbornly resist or compromise (not necessarily negative)
- Westeners tend to see things dualistically - something is either right or wrong, true or false, good or bad
- Even among Christians mores can greatly differ
  - Cussing and swearing is a no go in many parts of the US
  - Playing cards was not ok in the South of the US but becomes OK towards the north
  - Smoking is ok on the East Coast (where tobacco is grown) and becomes more and more unaccepable towards the west
  - Theater going was seen as very sinful in the past but became more accepted and sermons became more theatrical too
  - Playing billard is seen as very sinful among some Indonesian Christians
- Because of that we might interpret Biblical stories differently, like Sodom and Gomorrah
  - For Westerners the sin is obviously sodomy
  - For Indonesians it's inhospitality, they use Ezekiel 16:49 as support
    > Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did
      not help the poor and needy.
- For Westerners marriage (and sex within marriage) is preferable to singleness (and celibacy)
  - In India where the apostle Thomas preached the Gospel according to tradition, the message of celibacy was eagerly
    received since they were already influenced by Hinduism's ascetism
  - We would think it a misapplication of the gospel to talk an engaged couple out of marriage - but is that really so?
  - The Bible calls both marriage and singleness good - none is itself better than the other
  - Paul was considering Roman mores about sexual morality in [[reference.bible.1-corinthians.07]]
    ![[reference.bible.1-corinthians.07#background,1]]
- Westerners consider wealth an unlimited resource which can be accumulated without moral problems if you are successful
  enough
  - Many would even go so far and say if you don't have wealth then it's because you're lazy and not determined enough
  - In non Western cultures wealth is seen as limited and you live at the expense of others when you're rich
    - There's no good reason to accumulate more than you need and thus destroy others
- We Westerners tend to misread lessons about economic & social modesty as lessons about sexual modesty
  - Paul's admonition to women in 1 Cor 11 to cover their hair
    ![[reference.bible.1-corinthians.11#background,1]]
