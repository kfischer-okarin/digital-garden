## My Summary
- We read the Bible with certain preconceptions - things that go without being said - and that influences how we
  understand the texts - which were written in a different culture than ours

---

## Chapter 1 - Serving Two Masters (Mores)
- More - A fundamental moral view of a group
- If we are conflicted with a conflicting more we can either stubbornly resist or compromise (not necessarily negative)
- Westeners tend to see things dualistically - something is either right or wrong, true or false, good or bad
- Even among Christians mores can greatly differ
  - Cussing and swearing is a no go in many parts of the US
  - Playing cards was not ok in the South of the US but becomes OK towards the north
  - Smoking is ok on the East Coast (where tobacco is grown) and becomes more and more unaccepable towards the west
  - Theater going was seen as very sinful in the past but became more accepted and sermons became more theatrical too
  - Playing billard is seen as very sinful among some Indonesian Christians
- Because of that we might interpret Biblical stories differently, like Sodom and Gomorrah
  - For Westerners the sin is obviously sodomy
  - For Indonesians it's inhospitality, they use Ezekiel 16:49 as support
    > Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did
      not help the poor and needy.
- For Westerners marriage (and sex within marriage) is preferable to singleness (and celibacy)
  - In India where the apostle Thomas preached the Gospel according to tradition, the message of celibacy was eagerly
    received since they were already influenced by Hinduism's ascetism
  - We would think it a misapplication of the gospel to talk an engaged couple out of marriage - but is that really so?
  - The Bible calls both marriage and singleness good - none is itself better than the other
  - Paul was considering Roman mores about sexual morality in [[reference.bible.1-corinthians.07]]
    ![[reference.bible.1-corinthians.07#background,1]]
- Westerners consider wealth an unlimited resource which can be accumulated without moral problems if you are successful
  enough
  - Many would even go so far and say if you don't have wealth then it's because you're lazy and not determined enough
  - In non Western cultures wealth is seen as limited and you live at the expense of others when you're rich
    - There's no good reason to accumulate more than you need and thus destroy others
  - We Westerners tend to misread lessons about economic & social modesty as lessons about sexual modesty
    - Paul's admonition to women in 1 Cor 11 to cover their hair
      ![[reference.bible.1-corinthians.11#background,1]]
  - In 18th century New England people rented pews with their tithes... the social and financial hierarchy was clearly
    on display inside the church
  - Are we acting economically modest on Sundays? Do we display status and riches in the way we dress or display luxury
    goods to others around us?
- Different cultures have different "culturally edible" food
  - In Indonesia there's dog and rat meat, and they find the thought of us taking baby cow food and letting it go bad
    until it molds - cheese - appalling
  - For people growing up with certain cultural mores about food, this is not just a theological debate or a small thing
    - Asking a orthodox Jew or a Muslim to eat pork could be as repulsive as asking Westerners to eat cockroaches
  - This has practical implications too - how could a Jew share a table with someone whose breath stank of pig fat?
- How can we avoid these kind of instinctive interpretations distorting our interpretation of a Bible text?
  - When looking at a text go through these steps:
    - Clearly this passage is saying .... is right/wrong?
    - Is this really what is condemned?
    - Am I adding/removing elements
  - Look for clues in the text: Repeated words
  - Read Bible texts with Christians from other cultures
  - Read books of Christians from other cultures or time periods

## Chapter 2 - The Bible in Color (Race and Ethnicity)
- White children are more expensive to adopt in the US than children of color - even in Christian adoption agencies
- Nowadays Western culture starts to be "colorblind"
  - Since we don't want to make value statements about ethnicities - we hesitate to make any statements or distinctions
    at all
  - We want to make things simple by believing that ethnic differences don't matter at all - effectively that will mean
    that we believe that everyone should be treated as members of the majority culture
  - But that is naive and can result in serious misunderstanding - There are differences in dialect, worship style,
    dress, cuisine, prejudices etc
- For first century Romans it was totally fine to say: "He does such-and-such because he is a Jew"
