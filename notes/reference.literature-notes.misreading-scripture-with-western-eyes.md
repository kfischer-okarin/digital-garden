## My Summary
- We read the Bible with certain preconceptions - things that go without being said - and that influences how we
  understand the texts - which were written in a different culture than ours

---

## Chapter 1 - Serving Two Masters (Mores)
- More - A fundamental moral view of a group
- If we are conflicted with a conflicting more we can either stubbornly resist or compromise (not necessarily negative)
- Westeners tend to see things dualistically - something is either right or wrong, true or false, good or bad
- Even among Christians mores can greatly differ
  - Cussing and swearing is a no go in many parts of the US
  - Playing cards was not ok in the South of the US but becomes OK towards the north
  - Smoking is ok on the East Coast (where tobacco is grown) and becomes more and more unaccepable towards the west
  - Theater going was seen as very sinful in the past but became more accepted and sermons became more theatrical too
  - Playing billard is seen as very sinful among some Indonesian Christians
- Because of that we might interpret Biblical stories differently, like Sodom and Gomorrah
  - For Westerners the sin is obviously sodomy
  - For Indonesians it's inhospitality
