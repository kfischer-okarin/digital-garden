# Juice and Polish
- Main Principle: The game should react to the players actions - it should feel good

## Ways to spice things up action games
- Add sounds and animations
- Decrease enemy HP
- Increase shooting rate / add more enemies
- Bigger bullets
- Muzzle flash (cheap way: first frame of a bullet is a circle)
- Faster bullets
- Impact effects
- Hit animations (so you know the enemy was hit)
- Enemy knockback
- Permanence (leave traces of combats in the stage)
  - Destructible environment/props
  - Dead bodies... shells
  - Smoke fading away
- Camera lerp (lag behind the player)
- Camera position (show what's in front of the player/what's important)
- Screenshake
- Camera kick (moving back the camera when shooting)
- Player knockback (when shooting you are pushed back)
- Pause time on impact (even if it's just a frame)
- More bass in the sound effects
- Random (big!) explosions
- Death animation (slow fall and speed up again when on the floor)
