# Genesis 44

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+44&version=ESV)

## My Summary
- Joseph wants to test his brothers' character for one last time and arranges for them to be arrested and brought back
  by smuggling his silver cup into their belongings and arresting them for theft. He makes sure it's Benjamin who it is
  found with
- Joseph wants to keep Benjamin as a captive but Judah pleads with him to let him stay here instead because it would be
  too much for their father to lose Benjamin

## Central verses for me
> Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord, and let the boy go back
  with his brothers. For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would
  find my father.‚Äù
