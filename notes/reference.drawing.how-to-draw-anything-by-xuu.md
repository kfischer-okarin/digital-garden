## Step one: Draw the shrimp from your mind
- Draw a shrimp (or any other animal/thing you don't know 100% how to draw)
- Don't look at reerences, just draw a realistic shrimp from your mind
- Put this drawing away, don't look at it or change it until the end of the process

## Step two: Google References
- Collect as many high quality reference photos from real shrimps as you can
- Pick photos with different angles

## Step three: Trace references
- Take mental notes while tracing the references, where are the eyes? Where are the legs?
- Learn the anatomy of the thing
- Do this so long until you get bored with it

## Step four: Draw directly from the references
- Look at the reference and draw it without tracing
- Never edit old drawings, keep a history of your drawings

## Step five: Draw freely with references
- Draw the shrimp in different poses, for example draw a shrimp from the top using the side view reference
- Try also drawing other things than different perspectives like a shrimp doing different activities

## Step six: Draw the shrimp freely from your mind
- Don't look at any reference and draw the shrimp from your mind
- Finally compare the shrimp with your very first shrimp picture
- Congratulations you can draw a shrimp
