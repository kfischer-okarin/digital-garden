# 1 Corinthians 7

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&version=ESV)

## Background
- Paul was undermining Roman mores about human sexuality. Roman women were supposed to marry as early as possible and
  focus on childbearing and men were practically expected to commit adultery. Paul's teaching is granting liberty to
  women and placing moral restrictions on men at that time. (Source [[reference.literature-notes.misreading-scripture-with-western-eyes]], Chapter 1)
