# The universe shows God's greatness

> (3) When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,<br/>
> the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,<br/>
> (4) what is man that you are mindful of him,<br/>
> and the son of man that you care for him?

[Psalm 8:3-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+8%3A3-4&version=ESV) ([[reference.bible.psalms.008]])

Looking at the whole huge universe (the size of which we probably don't even begin to grasp), how great and powerful
must the being that made all of this be?

- **Epistemic Status:** One of my personal convictions as a Christian, contentwise yet a work in progress. Greatness
  is also maybe not the best word, but I need to understand the often used term "glory" better before I can use it with
  confidence.
