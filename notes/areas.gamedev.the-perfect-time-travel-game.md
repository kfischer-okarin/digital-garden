# The "perfect" time travel game

A game with a free form time-travel/manipulation system (think for example D-Mails in Steins;Gate) which you have to
exploit to continue with the story but also work as a sandbox. You could change anything and the chances of you ending
up in a hopeless timeline are not insignificant.

Requirement for that would be a somewhat complete model of causal relationships, so you could calculate the effects of
your time travel.

In order for a story to happen you would also need a model of the main story that is being told and the types of
stories that could occur, the potential dramatic conflicts that build up and might occur - so alternative timelines
could be constructed believably.

It would be maybe something like an AI Dungeon Master with enough knowledge to adjust the world in reaction to the time
manipulation.

There would also need to be a good setting and likeable characters you care about in the first place

  create - it's a work in progress.
