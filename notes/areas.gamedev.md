## My Motivation
![[areas.gamedev.my-motivation#^main-line]]

## Dream Game Elements / Inspirations

Independent and not necessarily related or having to be used together

- "Real" Dynamic Time Travel mechanic - simulate the changes in the past and reconstruct the world (Steins;Gate)
- A hub where characters gather, a place/city/area they call home (DS9, Future Gadget Lab)
- Random bizarre craziness (Rick and Morty's dimensions)
- "Floating" islands on pillars (**that** project)
- Kirby RPG
- The extraordinary hidden in plain sight / parallel magic/fantasy society (Harry Potter and others)
- Intelligent agents
