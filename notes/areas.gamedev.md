## Dream Game Elements / Inspirations

Independent and not necessarily related or having to be used together

- "Real" Dynamic Time Travel mechanic - simulate the changes in the past and reconstruct the world (Steins;Gate)
- A hub where characters gather, a place/city/area they call home (DS9, Future Gadget Lab)
- Random bizarre craziness (Rick and Morty's dimensions)
- "Floating" islands on pillars (**that** project)
- Kirby RPG
- The extraordinary hidden in plain sight / parallel magic/fantasy society (Harry Potter and others)
- Intelligent agents, AI, especially symbolic AI

## Narrative Tropes
- Start the story in medias res - specifically having only a little bit left of a bigger project (the penultimate task
  or only few more tasks)
  - Example: Just having found the third of four magic crystals you need to find to save the world
- A character was away from the main action for an extended amount of time and brings an unique perspective / hope on
  a situation
  - Example: Ant Man in Avengers: Endgame
