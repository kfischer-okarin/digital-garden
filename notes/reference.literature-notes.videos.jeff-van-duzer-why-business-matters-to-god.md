If we read only until human creation and know nothing else about God... Then we see that
[[he is a worker|ideas-thoughts-beliefs.theology.god-is-a-worker]] who creates good things.

[[ideas-thoughts-beliefs.theology.god-cares-about-the-material-world]]
- we actually don't see him create souls and angels etc

The garden of Eden was not complete
- it was perfect in the sense that it was perfectly resourced having all you might ever need
- but it was made to be worked by the human

## Two Purposes of business:
> Business exists to create opportunities for individuals to express aspects of their God given identity in meaningful
  and creative work

> Business exists in order to produce goods and services that would enable the community to flourish

Business exists to serve others
- internally to provide people with meaningful work
- externally to provide the community with resources

Profit is the means not the end, it's necessary to do your service

Business must be sustainable (environment and stakeholders)

Businesses for better or worse will have the most power to change the world more than any one nation can have

The world needs business leaders with a purpose
- they are usually amazing world changers
  - they are the best at getting a lot out of a little
  - they organize and deploy resources with remarkable efficiency
  - they tend to be optimistic
  - they look for the win win solution when everyone else just sees tradeoffs
  - once they think they're on the right course they are willing to stick with it even in face of enormous obstacles
