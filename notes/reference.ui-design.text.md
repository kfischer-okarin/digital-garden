## Use great fonts
- Check the fonts of great designs
- Have a collection of great fonts

## Font Size
- Not all font sizes work together well, use the calculator below to find sizes that work well together
- [[Tools for Finding Font Sizes|reference.tools-for.finding-font-sizes]]

## Line length
- One line should be between 45-75 characters ideally.
- Adjust text column width to fit that

## Text on Images
- Text on images usually looks good!
- But if the image could be anything (like an user-uploaded profile picture), readability can be a problem
- Some solutions:
  - Use a dark box around the text
  - Floor Fade - Use a black gradient on the bottom of the picture
  - Tint the whole picture
  - Text shadow (sometimes unreliable)
