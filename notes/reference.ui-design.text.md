## Use great fonts
- Check the fonts of great designs
- Have a collection of great fonts
- [[Tools for Finding Font Pairings|reference.tools-for.finding-font-pairings]]

## Font Size
- Not all font sizes work together well, use the calculator below to find sizes that work well together
- [[Tools for Finding Font Sizes|reference.tools-for.finding-font-sizes]]

## Line length
- One line should be between 45-75 characters ideally.
- Adjust text column width to fit that

## Use more Uppercase
- Feel free to use uppercase text in short text elements like menus, headlines, button labels
- It draws attention to those things
- It gives a bigger sense of alignment (i.e. that something was designed with intention)

## Text on Images
- Text on images usually looks good!
- But if the image could be anything (like an user-uploaded profile picture), readability can be a problem
- Some solutions:
  - Use a dark box around the text
  - Floor Fade - Use a black gradient on the bottom of the picture
  - Tint the whole picture
  - Text shadow (sometimes unreliable)

## Font Recommendations
- Fira Sans: clean/simple with a side of warmth/humanity
- Inter: Un-opinionated and readable. If I found myself thinking ‚ÄúMan, I really want to use Helvetica here‚Äù,
- Clear Sans
  - squared-off feel, brands that are data-driven, scientific, masculine, or authoritative
- Source Sans Pro
  - neutral character, just a touch of humanist warmth, works great for user interfaces
  - Has partner fonts: Source Serif, Source Code Pro (monospace) - but stands well on its own
- PT Serif: more formal, knowledgeable, academic, official, or authoritative settings
