# Genesis 41

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41&version=ESV)

## My Summary
- Two years after the cupbearer was released the Pharao began had two dreams: 7 fat cows followed by 7 thin cows who
  devoured them and the same dream with 7 fat ears of grain eaten by 7 thin ears.
- The cupbearer remembered Joseph and told the Pharao about him and Joseph was taken out of prison
- He told him the message that God wanted the Pharao to know through this dreams, namely that 7 years of abundance would
  come followed by 7 years of famine and that Egypt needs to prepare for this
- Pharao decided to let Joseph handle this since he seems to have great wisdom and he made him second in authority over
  Egypt
- He was also given the daughter of an important priest as wife. She gave birth to Manasse and Ephraim who should become
  heirs of Israel later
    - So part of Israel is actually half-Egyptian in heritage
- The events predicted by the dream came true and Joseph stored the surplus of grain in the 7 abundant years
- Then the famine years came and Joseph began to sell the stored grain to the Egyptians and also to foreigners

## Central verses

> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you
  that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” Joseph answered Pharaoh, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a
  favorable answer.”

[Genesis 41:15-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A15-16&version=ESV)

> Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. “For,” he said, “God has made me forget all my hardship and all my
  father's house.” The name of the second he called Ephraim, “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my
  affliction.”
