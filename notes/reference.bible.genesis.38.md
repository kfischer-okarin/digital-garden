# Genesis 38

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+38&version=ESV)

## My Summary

Judah sleeps with his daughter-in-law Tamar
- Judah moved away from his brothers and married a Canaanite woman
- He had three sons Er, Onan and Shelah, Tamar was Er's wife
- Er was an immoral person so the Lord let him die
- Then Onan was asked to give a son to Tamar so Er's family would continue but he refused to do so, so the Lord let him
  die, too
- Judah outwardly promised Tamar to give Shelah to her once he was old enough but never intended to do so since he was
  afraid that he might also die
- Eventually Shelah was old enough and was not given to Tamar
- Judah's wife had died by now and one day when he went out to shear his sheep Tamar dressed up with a veil as a
  prostitute and waited for him at the street
- Judah slept with her after she took Judah's signet and cord as a pledge for her eventual payment
  - Judah went back to give her her payment but couldn't find her and forgot about her
- When it was known that Tamar was pregnant, Judah ordered her to be burned for prostitution - but she then presented
  his possessions she had taken as pledge in defense and Judah admitted his fault
  - He let her live in his house but never touched her again
- Tamar gave birth to twins, Perez and Zerah

Because of this incident she becomes one of the ancestors of Jesus.
