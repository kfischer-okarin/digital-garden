## What's the big idea here?
- What's my product's biggest benefit?
- What's most exciting about this product?
- What emotion am I trying to create.

## Principles
- Define your ideal customer
- Write directly to them
- Focus on headline and first sentence

## Flow
1. Here's your problem
2. Here's the benefit of solving it
3. Here's why what you've tried has failed
4. And by the way here's a product that will help you solve it
5. (some people add) And here's some people who had that problem and solved it with this product

## Sentence structure

### 1/3/1
> This first sentence is your opener.
>
> This second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sentence reinforces the point you're making with some sort of credibility or amplified description. And this fourth sentence rounds out your argument, guiding the reader toward your conclusion.
>
> This fifth sentence is your strong conclusion.

What makes this 1/3/1 sequence "work" is that the first sentence and the last sentence act as bookends to the bulk of the content in the middle. These single-sentence lines make the reader feel as though they've reached a checkpoint, which acts as a small dopamine hit encouraging them to continue reading.

1/3/1 is an especially great framework for introductions and openers, but the truth is, it can be used anytime, anywhere within your writing. In fact, you could write an entire essay or article (or even book) using the 1/3/1 sequence and readers wouldn't realize you were following a pattern. They would just think to themselves, "Wow, this thing flows so well! It's so easy to read."

Here's an example of the 1/3/1 sequence in action:

> 100 years ago, The Campbells's Soup Company had a breakthrough.
>
> For 30 years, the business sold little else besides produce, canned tomatoes, vegetables, jellies, condiments, minced
> meats, and of course, soups. Business was good, but there was nothing "radically different" about these products.
> Canning had been widely accepted as a method for sealing food since the early 1800s, and even when pasteurization was
> invented in 1864, fresh foods were difficult products to scale. Soup, for example, while cheap to make (its primary
> ingredient being water), was still heavy and expensive to ship.
>
> Until, in 1895, a chemist within the company named John T. Dorrance came up with a radically different idea.
