## External Conflict - what's happening to the character
- Internal Conflict & external conflict need each other
- What does the main character want? -> External conflict
  - Main categories for concrete goals:
    - Win
    - Stop
    - Escape
    - Retrieve

## Internal conflict - The main character's misbelief
- What is your core theme?
  - The story's truth
  - What change would you like to see in the world?
  - What is the truth that you want to scream from the rooftops?
  - This drives your whole story... this is why you care about the story
- Turn the theme into the opposite - into a lie... this is the core misbelief
- What could have happened in the character's past to make them believe such a thing?
  - Can be a traumatic event... Can be a slow dripping continuous impact that makes a hole into the sone
  - Children until 7 years old believe almost everything - their brain is still forming
- Write that pivotal scene! It will help you understand that character's thought process... internal workings...
  - This is the motive driving the goal of the character
- Write more other scenes that cement the character's misbelief
  - Situations where they were challenged and had the chance to step out and discover the truth - but instead chose the
    lie - and cemented their belief
- How is my character dissatisfied with their life today because of their firm belief into that lie?
- What does my character think will make them happy? (based on their misbelief?)
  - This is their goal that will drive he plot
- What steps could my character take now to actively pursue this goal?
  - This becomes the plot - driven by the character!
