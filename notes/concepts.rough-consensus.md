# Rough Consensus

## Real consensus
- It's not about full agreement
- Ask: "Can anyone not live with Option A?"
  - If somebody comes up follow up with: "What are the reasons you object to choice A?"
    - Either the work group can be convinced that this is really not a good idea and changes path
    - Or the objecting person can be convinced that this is just unappealing and that they are actually able to
      live with it
- States of affairs that are actually not consensus
  - Apathy towards the proposed solution - the people working on it must engage actively and support it eventually
  - People agree that a solution is sufficient and have no objection to it, but don't actively think it's a good and
    correct outcome
  - A group with a real objection loses energy to argue and enters a "Do what you want" stance
  - Two parties with objections to each other's proposals make a "horse-trade" and agree to stop objecting to each other
    so that both can be included

## Rough Consensus
- The group has considered and acknowledged a the real objection of a person but the vast majority still thinks that it
  is a good idea to go on with the current solution even if it means a tradeoff and the objector is not happy
- This relies a lot on the chair of the group who has the right to call rough consensus
  - They must make sure to have properly and fully weighed the objection and its technical ramifications and that the
    group has made sure that leaving this objection unaccomodated will not result in failure to meet the specifications
    of the solution
- This call can be appealed
- The chair can also decide in hindsight if the group dismissed an objection right away that the group must reconsider
  it properly
- This methodology allows minority views to be also heard
