# Writing well

- Have one very clear purpose/topic

## Steps from Writing, Briefly by Paul Graham

Source: http://paulgraham.com/writing44.html

1. Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can
2. Rewrite it over and over
3. Cut out everything unnecessary
4. Write in a conversational tone
5. Develop a nose for bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours;
6. Imitate writers you like
7. If you can't get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said
8. Expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be
   wrong
9. Be confident enough to cut
10. Have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which bits are confusing or drag
11. Don't (always) make detailed outlines
12. Mull ideas over for a few days before writing; carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you
13. Start writing when you think of the first sentence; if a deadline forces you to start before that, just say the most
    important sentence first
14. Write about stuff you like
15. Don't try to sound impressive
16. Don't hesitate to change the topic on the fly
17. Use footnotes to contain digressions
18. Use anaphora to knit sentences together
19. Read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the
    paragraphs you dread reading)
20. Try to tell the reader something new and useful
21. Work in fairly big quanta of time
22. When you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far
23. When you finish, leave yourself something easy to start with
24. Accumulate notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don't feel obliged to cover any of them;
25. Write for a reader who won't read the essay as carefully as you do, just as pop songs are designed to sound ok on
    crappy car radios
26. If you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately
27. Ask friends which sentence you'll regret most
28. Go back and tone down harsh remarks
29. Publish stuff online, because an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more ideas
30. Print out drafts instead of just looking at them on the screen
31. Use simple, germanic words
32. Learn to distinguish surprises from digressions
33. Learn to recognize the approach of an ending, and when one appears, grab it.
