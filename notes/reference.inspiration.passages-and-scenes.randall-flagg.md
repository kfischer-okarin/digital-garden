# Randall Flagg

> There was a dark hilarity in his face, and perhaps in his heart, too, you would think - and you would be right. It was
  the face of a hatefully happy man, a face that radiated a horrible handsome warmth, a face to make waterglasses
  shatter in the hands of tired truck-stop waitresses, to make small children crash their trikes into board fences and
  then run wailing to their mommies with stake-shaped splinters sticking out of their knees. It was a face guaranteed
  to make barroom arguments over batting averages turn bloody.

The Stand, Chapter 23

> He looks like anybody you see on the street. But when he grins, birds fall dead off telephone lines. When he looks at
  you a certain way, your prostate goes bad and your urine burns. The grass yellows up and dies where he spits. He's
  always outside. he came out of time. He doesn't know himself. He has the name of a thousand demons. Jesus knocked him
  into a herd of pigs once. His name is Legion. He is afraid of us. We're inside. He knows magic. He can call the wolves
  and live in the crows. He's the king of nowhere. But he's afraid of us. He's afraid of... inside.

The Stand, Chapter 55
