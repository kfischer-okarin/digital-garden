# Matthew 13

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13&version=ESV)

## My Summary
Jesus tells a lot of parables about the kingdom of God

- The parable of the sower and the 4 types of soil (with explanation later)
  - The seed is the word of God and the soils are ways how people will take and apply the word in their life
  - The soils are:
    - The path where birds eat the seed
      - The word doesn't even reach the heart of the person. Satan took it away.
    - Solid rock where the seeed could not have deep roots and the plants die immediately when the sun rises
      - Someone who receives it happily but falls away when trials or persecution come since they lack faith roots
    - Thorns that choke the plants
      - People distracted by worries/cares of the world and riches so they cannot focus on the word aren't effective
        for the kingdom
    - Good soil
      - People who take the word, apply it and bring fruit
- The parable about another farmer, who planted wheat but an enemy mixed weeds into the same field. His servants ask
  him whether they should pull out the weeds but the tells them to wait until harvest time otherwise the wheat will
  also be damaged (with explanation later)
  - It seems that those particular weeds and wheat look very similar when young (Source? I heard that often said
    in sermons)
  - This is a parable about believers and unbelievers as Jesus explains later. Jesus brings the good news to the people
    but Satan has put his children among them. God might not remove/judge them right away - but in the end that sorting
    will be done by his angels at judgement day.
- The parable of the mustard seed
  - It's a tiny seed but turns into a huge tree
  - The kingdom also starts small and invisibly but has a huge influence
- The parable of the leaven
  - Leaven is small compared to the whole dough but it takes just a little time for it all to become leavened
  - Similar meaning as the one with the mustard seed
- Parables about treasures
  - The parable of the hidden treasure
    - The man who stumbled across the treasure sold everything to buy the land as fast as he could
  - The parable of the pearl
    - The merchant actively looked for the pearl, he also sold everything he had to buy it
  - Both are often interpreted as teaching that believers should be willing to give up everything to gain eternal life,
    enter the kingdom
    - But considering the other parables about "found" things (coins, sheep, son) have God as the person seeking the
      lost, it would make sense that God is the protagonist in this parable too
    - God giving up everything, i.e. his only Son so humans could be reconciled with him... We are so precious to God.
      That seems to fit the gospel message more than a kind of holy pressure to sacrifice everything to get inside the
      kingdom
- The parable of the fisher's net
  - Good fish and bad fish are caught, they are sorted in the end

Some other content
- Matthew mentioned that this use of parables is a fulfillment of
  [Psalm 78:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+78%3A2&version=ESV)
  ([[Psalm 78|reference.bible.psalms.078]])
- The disciples ask Jesus why he speaks in parables and he answers that it is to hide the truth from those "to whom it
  has not been given to know the secrets of the kingdom"
    - He quotes [Isaiah 6:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+6%3A9-10&version=ESV)
      ([[Isaiah 6|reference.bible.isaiah.06]])
- Jesus says that scribes who enter the kingdom have lots of blessings to give
  - probably speaking about the deep  knowledge of the Old Testament and the old covenant showing its true value once
    you see it in light of Jesus
  - And being able to help other believers with your expertise
- Finally Jesus is teaching in his hometown Nazareth but is rejected and not taken seriously there
  - He didn't do a lot of miracles there because of their unbelief

## Open questions / Difficult passages
- > For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what
    he has will be taken away.

  [Matthew 13:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A12&version=ESV)

  and the following verses 13-15 about seeing but not understanding.
  - God is love (1 John 4:8) and wants all to come to a knowledge of the truth (1 Timothy 2:4), so what is this kind of
    thing supposed to mean in that context?
    - Is this a description of "how the world works"? How sinful stubbornness affects human hearts and understanding in
      general?
    - This could be like the hardening of the Pharaoh's heart? (Which is a difficult topic, too)
- Does the parable of the weed contain practical wisdom/instruction for churches/communities?
  - It it mainly an encouragement/description of how God will eventually handle everything and therefore we do not
    need to judge/exclude/be disappointed too much about unbelievers?
