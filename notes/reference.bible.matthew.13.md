# Matthew 13

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13&version=ESV)

## My Summary
- Jesus tells the parable of the sower and the 4 types of soil, and explains it later
  - The seed is the word of God and the soils are ways how people will take and apply the word in their life
  - The soils are:
    - The path where birds eat the seed
      - The word doesn't even reach the heart of the person. Satan took it away.
    - Solid rock where the seeed could not have deep roots and the plants die immediately when the sun rises
      - Someone who receives it happily but falls away when trials or persecution come since they lack faith roots
    - Thorns that choke the plants
      - People distracted by worries/cares of the world and riches so they cannot focus on the word aren't effective
        for the kingdom
    - Good soil
      - People who take the word, apply it and bring fruit
- The disciples ask Jesus why he speaks in parables and he answers that it is to hide the truth from those "to whom it
  has not been given to know the secrets of the kingdom"
    - He quotes [Isaiah 6:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+6%3A9-10&version=ESV)
      ([[Isaiah 6|reference.bible.isaiah.06]])
- Jesus tells another parable about about another farmer, who planted wheat but an enemy mixed weeds into the same
  field. His servants ask him whether they should pull out the weeds but the tells them to wait until harvest time
  otherwise the wheat will also be damaged
  - It seems that those particular weeds and wheat look very similar when young (Source? I heard that often said
    in sermons)
  - This seems to be a parable about believers and unbelievers. God might not remove/judge people who will never
    believe right away - but in the end that sorting will be done at judgement day.
- (TODO: Second half)


## Open questions / Difficult passages
- > For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what
    he has will be taken away.

  [Matthew 13:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A12&version=ESV)

  and the following verses 13-15 about seeing but not understanding.
  - God is love (1 John 4:8) and wants all to come to a knowledge of the truth (1 Timothy 2:4), so what is this kind of
    thing supposed to mean in that context?
    - Is this a description of "how the world works"? How sinful stubbornness affects human hearts and understanding in
      general?
    - This could be like the hardening of the Pharaoh's heart? (Which is a difficult topic, too)
- Does the parable of the weed contain practical wisdom/instruction for churches/communities?
  - It it mainly an encouragement/description of how God will eventually handle everything and therefore we do not
    need to judge/exclude/be disappointed too much about unbelievers or maybe even believers with seemingly no fruit?
