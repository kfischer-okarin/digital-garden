# Genesis 46

[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+46&version=ESV)

## My Summary
- Jacob has a vision of God in which he is told that he doesn't need to be afraid to go to Egypt and that his
  descendants would eventually come back to this land
- All members of Jacob's family that end up in Egypt are listed
- Jacob and his son Joseph finally reunite

## Central verses for me
> Then he said, “I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into
  a great nation. I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again, and Joseph's hand shall
  close your eyes.”

[Genesis 45:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+46%3A3-4&version=ESV)
