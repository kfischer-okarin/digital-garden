<ul>
<li>Doing excellent work is part our service for God</li>
<li>Faith helps us to
<ul>
<li>keep our self-worth independent of our ability to work</li>
<li>see the inherent dignity of all work</li>
<li>keep our integrity even during temptations</li>
<li>have hope that it will bear fruit even if we don't see it right away (or ever during our life)</li>
<li>be a light and salt in our sphere of influence</li>

<ul>
<li>Isn't the job of the church simply to preach the word and bring people to Christ? Do we really need cultural
engagement?</li>
<li>Thus: Evangelizing and discipling people
<ul>
<li>Discipling: Teaching to obey Christ in every area of one's life</li>
<li>For people working out there in the actual culture, that means you necessarily will engage with the culture</li>

<ul>
<li>Example from Alasdair MacIntyre's book "After Virtue"</li>
<li>Imagine you stand at a bus stop and a young man comes to you and tells you: "The name of the common wild duck is
histrionicus histrionicus histrionicus"
<ul>
<li>That doesn't make sense unless you embed it into a story
<ul>
<li>Maybe he's mentally ill</li>
<li>Maybe yesterday someone who looked like you asked him for the name of the common wild duck</li>
<li>Maybe he's a foreign spy waiting at a pre arranged rendezvous and just uttered this code sentece to identify
himself to his contact</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your action will be decided by which story you put this action into</li>

<h2 id="many-christians-think-only-church-is-gods-work-549---645">Many Christians think only church is God's work (5:49 - 6:45)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#many-christians-think-only-church-is-gods-work-549---645"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Many Christians think: In church I'm doing God's work, out here I'm just making a living so I can do God's work or
give to missions</li>
<li>Negative effects of that attitude:
<ul>
<li>Making no effort to shape your work by your faith, you will seal it away from your work</li>
<li>You will usually just blend in with the work culture</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But: Jesus is a king, the king of every area of your life, you cannot conveniently compartmentalize your life like
that</li>

<p><a href="/digital-garden/notes/sfwjuh3wtk172vzhu7hma0v">The Story of the Bible</a> and how it relates to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation
<ul>
<li>God is the creator of all things in this material world, including work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fall
<ul>
<li>Sin is distorting every area of your life, including church life and work</li>
<li>Church life is not inherently more sacred than work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Redemption
<ul>
<li>All things/areas are made new - including your work life!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Restoration
<ul>
<li>God is restoring this material world in the end, we will not be taken away to some spritual netherworld, this
shows us the goodness of work and the future of work</li>

<ul>
<li>Nowadays your work often becomes your identify, self-worth, self-importance, sense of competence</li>
<li>If work is your identity, it enslaves you
<ul>
<li>If you're good at your job, you get full of yourself
<ul>
<li>Because you're good at one thing you think you're good at everything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You cannot look at your own work honestly anymore because you <strong>need</strong> it to be great</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In western culture work is an end to itself
<ul>
<li>Whereas in more traditional cultures your main identity, was through your role in the family, work was a means to
that end - this is also not the biblical view</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Christ gives you a deep identity and a deep certainty of your worth, which is independent of your work and performance</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faith-gives-you-a-concept-of-the-dignity-of-all-work-even-simple-work-without-which-work-could-bore-you-1341---1832">Faith gives you a concept of the dignity of all work even simple work without which work could bore you (13:41 - 18:32)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#faith-gives-you-a-concept-of-the-dignity-of-all-work-even-simple-work-without-which-work-could-bore-you-1341---1832"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>God has chosen to use simple farm workers, truck drivers, etc to feed the world
<ul>
<li>They are the fingers of God</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All work is God's work of caring for creation</li>
<li>We cannot participate in a sneering attitude towards people working in service or other simple jobs</li>
<li>Doing work as a Christian means first and foremost doing good work</li>
<li>Even if you have a job that's not really exciting you can know that your work matters</li>

<ul>
<li>In many professions there's a lot of pressure to do whatever it takes to turn a profit</li>
<li>The world (college) tells you that morality is relative
<ul>
<li>(but then again you will be mercilessly judged and canceled or worse if you get caught doing something immoral
during your job)</li>

<li>We as Christians have an immovable strong moral compass to stand solid in this kind of headwind</li>

<ul>
<li>In some vocations your worldview determines everything about how you approach your job:

<ul>
<li>Because of the fall our work and our efforts are often so frustrating, so little and so imperfect no matter how hard
we try - it's all thorns and thistles
<ul>
<li>It's as if we were a painter who tries to paint a tree for all his life and in the end after much work only gets out
a little leaf</li>
<li>But there will be a perfect future, there will be perfect beauty, perfect justice, a perfect city in heaven</li>
