# The Story of the Bible

Possible source: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/the-story-and-message-of-the-bible/

## Creation
- God is the creator of all things and all things he created are good

## Fall
- Total Depravity
  - Not: You are not as bad as you can be
  - If sin was blue, you would be blue all over, it affects all of your life

## Redemption

## Restoration
