**Current position:** Chapter 1 - The Promise

## Basic Principles
- Capture **all** the things that are on your mind in a **trusted** system
- Separate thinking about what to do and actual doing
  - This will result in a directly actionable list of "Next Actions"
- Have regular reviews of your projects and commitments

## Our live and work is complex and fast-paced
- People have more concurrent ongoing commitments/projects than in the past
- With physical labor it's usually clear when work was done, a field plowed, a bread baked etc
  - Nowadays the definition of "Done" is not so clear anymore
  - When is your plan, article, meeting preparation etc perfect? - You could always do more, always use more information
    etc
- Work is more complex and involves communicating with many people often from other departments and of other professions
- Teams work globally thanks to modern technology
- Most people don't do only what they were hired for
- Commitment to continual learning
- Changes in life are frequent and often times sudden (health issues, family, financial challenges)
- Work is too fast and unpredictable to be accomodated by classical calendars and todo lists only

## Focusing on the bigger picture is hard
- Day to day and hour to hour work life is too distracting to allow time and focus for bigger picture thinking
- Ineffective organization systems build up internal resistance to tackling anything complex
- When we think about higher levels, our standard of living and working usually rises and that causes more work that
  needs to be organized


## Quotes
> Most of us have, in the past seventy-two hours, received more change-producing, project-creating and priority-shifting
  inputs than our parents did in a month, maybe even a year.
