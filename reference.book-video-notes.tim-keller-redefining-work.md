## The Great Commission needs cultural engagement (2:07-2:52)
- Isn't the job of the church simply to preach the word and bring people to Christ? Do we really need cultural
  engagement?
- Thus: Evangelizing and discipling people
  - Discipling: Teaching to obey Christ in every area of one's life
  - For people working out there in the actual culture, that means you necessarily will engage with the culture

## You need a story to make sense of things (3:15-5:42)
- Example from Alasdair MacIntyre's book "After Virtue"
- Imagine you stand at a bus stop and a young man comes to you and tells you: "The name of the common wild duck is
  histrionicus histrionicus histrionicus"
  - That doesn't make sense unless you embed it into a story
    - Maybe he's mentally ill
    - Maybe yesterday someone who looked like you asked him for the name of the common wild duck
    - Maybe he's a foreign spy waiting at a pre arranged rendezvous and just uttered this code sentece to identify
      himself to his contact
  - Your action will be decided by which story you put this action into

## Many Christians think only church is God's work (5:49 - 6:45)
- Many Christians think: In church I'm doing God's work, out here I'm just making a living so I can do God's work or
  give to missions
- Negative effects of that attitude:
  - Making no effort to shape your work by your faith, you will seal it away from your work
  - You will usually just blend in with the work culture
- But: Jesus is a king, the king of every area of your life, you cannot conveniently compartmentalize your life like
  that

## Work under the lens of the Story of the Bible (6:45 - 8:19)
![[The Story of the Bible|reference.concepts.the-story-of-the-bible]] and how it relates to work:
- Creation
  - God is the creator of all things in this material world, including work
- Fall
  - Sin is distorting every area of your life, including church life and work
  - Church life is not inherently more sacred than work
- Redemption
  - All things/areas are made new - including your work life!
- Restoration
  - God is restoring this material world in the end, we will not be taken away to some spritual netherworld, this
    shows us the goodness of work and the future of work

## Quotes
> Your work will make no sense to you unless you put it into some kind of story
