# Concepts

This will be where notes that describe concepts live. Andy Matuschak calls them Evergreen Notes[^1].

## Guiding principles while writing:
- About one concept
- Densely linked
- Mainly for myself, disregarding audience

## How to write a concept note:

> - figure out the key statement
> - write the note in your own words
> - relate the idea in the note to your personal experiences
> - link the idea in the note to other ideas

> - Write a broad note which captures the “big idea” of one of your clusters.
>   - Are there multiple big ideas? Write multiple broad notes to maintain Evergreen notes should be atomic.
> - Write finer-grained notes: Look through the individual scraps in that cluster. Write notes which capture more nuanced atomic ideas within that cluster.
> - Connect: Search for relevant past notes which relate to these new notes. Link, merge, and revise as necessary to represent your new, synthesized conception of those ideas.
>   - See Evergreen notes should be densely linked and Create speculative outlines while you write.
> - Revise: Return to the broad note and improve your summary based on what you’ve learned writing the detailed notes and the details you’ve unpacked, if it’s possible to do so without muddying their focus. Remove detailed notes that are no longer necessary; update others based on what you learned writing your updated broad note if appropriate.
> - Loop
